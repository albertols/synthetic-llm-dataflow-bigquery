"""The generator's command line as the launch surfaces must mirror it.

The Flex Template declares every parameter optional (one template serves
two jobs, and a launch for one cannot be made to supply the other's), so
the template no longer says which flags a generation launch needs:
`run_pipeline`'s own parser does. Tests that tie a launch surface (the
template metadata, the Composer DAG, the personal-GCP tiers) to the CLI read
the parser through this module.

`run_pipeline.parse_args` builds its parser inside the function and offers
no factory, so the parser is taken from one parse that is stopped before it
reads anything.
