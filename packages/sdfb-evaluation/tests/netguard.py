"""No test of this package reaches the network.

A `NetworkGuard`, while installed, replaces the ways Python code leaves
the machine or goes looking for credentials:

    socket.socket.connect / connect_ex   a non-loopback address
    socket.socket.sendto / sendmsg       a datagram to one (UDP needs no
                                         connection)
    socket.getaddrinfo, gethostbyname,   a host name other than localhost,
      gethostbyname_ex, gethostbyaddr    or the reverse lookup of an address
                                         off this machine
    google.auth.default                  Application Default Credentials
                                         (Beam and the Google clients ask
                                         for them before their first call)

It patches Python's `socket` module, so it sees what goes through it:
not a C extension's own sockets (gRPC's core), a subprocess, or code
that ran at import time, before the guard was installed.

Each attempt is recorded and fails the test at once (`pytest.fail`, which
`except Exception` does not catch); one that the code under test swallows
anyway fails the test when it ends (`verify`). Loopback addresses and
unix sockets stay open: the DirectRunner and its local services use them.

`tests/conftest.py` installs one guard for the whole session — so
module- and session-scoped fixtures are guarded too — and lifts it only
around a test marked `gcp`.
