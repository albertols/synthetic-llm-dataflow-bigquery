"""Test tables for the nearest-neighbour privacy and detection pass: the
invented `people` table of the membership tests (planned by the real
planner), sized for a 2,000-row R/H panel, with planted defects —
verbatim copies of R records, a shifted amount column, whole-row
duplicates — and a key-less `catalog` table whose rows are drawn from a
few hundred (category, brand, size) patterns, so whole rows repeat.

Nothing here is real data: invented names, `example.com` e-mails, ids in
invented ranges (source 7_000_000+, synthetic 5_000_000+).
