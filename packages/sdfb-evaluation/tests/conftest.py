"""Pytest config + shared fixtures.

One `netguard.NetworkGuard` is installed for the whole session: no test
(and no fixture of any scope) can connect off this machine, resolve a
host name or look for Google credentials. It is lifted only around a
test marked `gcp`. The `no_network` fixture (autouse) fails a test whose
code swallowed an attempt, and gives a test the list of attempts.

The default Beam runner of the session is `FnApiRunner`, Beam's
in-process Python runner, never the switching `DirectRunner`: a test
that builds a pipeline without naming a runner (`TestPipeline()`,
`beam.Pipeline()`) would otherwise hand a batch pipeline to Prism
wherever the Prism binary is cached or can be downloaded, and Prism
starts a step before its batch side input is complete
(`sdfb_evaluation.beam.pipeline`, Runners) — every transform here reads
side inputs. On `FnApiRunner` a stage runs to completion before the
stages reading it, the batch contract Dataflow holds too. It is set
here, at the package root, so every test directory gets it whatever the
collection order.
