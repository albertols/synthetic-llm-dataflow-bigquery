"""BigQuery statement rules the context fakes enforce, so a statement
BigQuery would reject fails the laptop suite too.

Time travel (query syntax, FOR SYSTEM_TIME AS OF): "A single query
statement can't reference a single table at more than one point in time,
including the current time." Every table reference in a statement is one
reference — at the `[TIMESTAMP] '…'` literal of a directly following
`FOR SYSTEM_TIME AS OF` (case- and whitespace-insensitive, an optional
`[AS] alias` allowed in between), else at the current time. A reference
is `` `project.dataset.table` ``: fully or partially backtick-quoted, or
bare, and `project:dataset.table` normalises to `project.dataset.table`
(the same table read under either spelling is the same reference).

This must fail CLOSED: a `FOR SYSTEM_TIME AS OF` this module cannot parse
(a query parameter, an expression such as `TIMESTAMP_SUB(...)`, anything
that is not a literal) is never silently read as the current time — that
would hide a real violation. `points_in_time` raises `AssertionError` on
one instead.
