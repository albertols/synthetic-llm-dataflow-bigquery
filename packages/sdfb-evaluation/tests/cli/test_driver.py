"""Tests for `sdfb-eval run` as a driver (Task 27, Rulings R88, R90, R93):
the registry events it writes around the pipeline and who owns the one
terminal row, the exit codes, the `--fail_on` gate, the free-text pools
read, the temporary directory and the flex-template entry.

The pipeline here is a stand-in (`helpers.tiny_pipeline`: only a FINAL
registry row, or nothing) and, for a submitted job, a result whose state
the test controls (`helpers.FakeJob`); the real graph runs in
`test_run.py`.
