"""Tests for how `sdfb-eval run` chooses its read path (Task 44): the
probe of the Storage Read API after the prepare statements, the paged
read it selects on a refusal and what the launch says about it, and the
timed lines inside the submission.

The probe here is a fake (the laptop has no Google Cloud); the read
itself is tested in `beam/test_io_paged.py`.
