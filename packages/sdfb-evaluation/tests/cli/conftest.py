"""Fixtures of the CLI tests.

The packaged catalogue is immutable, and parsing its YAML takes about a
quarter of a second; a CLI run asks for it several times (the planner,
the registry rows, the thresholds file, the renderers). `cached_catalogue` parses
it once for the whole session, which keeps these tests inside their
60-second budget (Ruling R88i).

`scratch` points `tempfile` at the test's own directory, so a run that
keeps its temporary output (a failed `--sink bq_client` run does) leaves
nothing in the machine's temp directory.
