"""The chained evaluation verifies the generator's reference sample (R136).

`--seed_table T --generation_job_id J --validation_runs_table V` reads the
Dataflow job (for its window) and this launch's rows of V (one query), and
nothing else about the job. The digest on the row is what makes the panel
`verified`; these tests follow it down to the two places that decide
whether the reference-based metrics run:
`beam.privacy._panel_reason` (the nearest-neighbour metrics) and
`beam.membership.PanelRefs.from_table` (the panel-based match rates and
lifts). The tables are big enough for a real panel: R and H hold
`MIN_PANEL_ROWS` rows each.
