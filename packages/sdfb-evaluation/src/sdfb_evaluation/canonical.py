"""Canonical value encoding, row digests, uint64 column hashing, and the
linear/leave-one-out (LOO) row hashes built on top of them.

Two BigQuery client libraries can read the same cell as different Python
types (a `Decimal("10.50")` from one read path, a `Decimal("10.5")` from
another; a naive `datetime` from one, a UTC-aware one from another).
`canonical_value` maps every BigQuery-relevant Python type to one
type-stable representation, so `canonical_json`/`row_digest`/`hash64` give
the same digest regardless of which client produced the value.

`hash64` turns one `(column, value)` cell into a uint64 that is stable
under that same canonicalisation and gives NULL its own, column-independent
code (`NULL_CODE`) so that a NULL never collides with a real hashed value.
`hash_matrix` batches this over rows x columns; `multipliers`/`linear_hash`
combine the per-column hashes into one row-level uint64 (a fast approximate
row-equality test — see `row_digest` for the exact, digest-based version);
`loo_hashes` derives, from that same matrix, the row hash *without* each
column in turn, which is what a leave-one-out near-match search needs
(Ruling R2): it must work for any column set and any value type, numeric
included, which is why it is built on `hash64` rather than a numeric-only
shortcut.

All of the uint64 arithmetic below is meant to wrap silently at 2**64 (it
is a hash, not a checksum), hence `np.errstate(over="ignore")` around every
numpy integer op that could overflow.
