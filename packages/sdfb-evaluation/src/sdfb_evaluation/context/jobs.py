"""What a generation job wrote to BigQuery, read from BigQuery itself.

Beam's `WriteToBigQuery` labels every load and copy job it submits with
`beam_job_id=<Dataflow job id>` when it runs on Dataflow (Beam's
`bigquery_io_metadata`), and stages FILE_LOADS through temporary tables
named `beam_bq_job_…` that it then copies into the destination.
`INFORMATION_SCHEMA.JOBS_BY_PROJECT` therefore answers "which tables did
job X commit rows to, and when", independently of any log retention:

    JOBS_BY_PROJECT ──(label beam_job_id = X, DONE, no error,
                       LOAD|COPY, destination not beam_bq_job_*)──► JobWrite
          │
          └── jobs.get(job) ── statistics.load.outputRows
                               statistics.copy.copiedRows ──► output_rows

Both reads need `roles/bigquery.resourceViewer` on the project the jobs ran
in (`bigquery.jobs.listAll` for the view, `bigquery.jobs.get` for another
principal's job); a denial is raised as `PermissionError` naming that role.

`foreign_writes` is the contamination check: every committed write into
one table inside a window by anything other than job X — another Dataflow
job, a DML statement, a manual load. The view only lists jobs run IN the
queried project; a writer billed to another project stays invisible.
