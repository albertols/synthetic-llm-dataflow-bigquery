"""A standalone mirror of the generator's reference-sample provenance —
the row digest and the exact query that produced the sample it digests —
and the R/E/H panel rebuilt from the same order (D3).

The generator's reference sample R is the first n rows of the source
under ONE order, `ORDER BY FARM_FINGERPRINT(TO_JSON_STRING(ref))`
(`REFERENCE_ORDER_BY`, shared by `reference_sql` and `panel_sql`). The
panel reads the first 2n rows of that same order from the pinned source:

    rank  1 ………… 1024 ………… n │ n+1 ………… n+1024 ………… 2n
          ├─── E ───┤           │ ├── H_E ───┤
          ├────────── R ────────┤ ├──────────── H ────────────┤
          = the generator's        = the next n rows: the holdout,
            LIMIT n sample           exchangeable with R

E (the first `EXPOSURE_ROWS` = 1024 ranks) is what the B.1 engine embeds
as row docs, i.e. what prompts could have seen. R is re-hashed with the
generator's digest and compared with the digest it recorded
(`Panel.verified`).

Ties. Two rows share a fingerprint only when their `TO_JSON_STRING` is
identical (duplicate rows) or on a 64-bit collision between distinct
rows. `LIMIT` and `ROW_NUMBER` order tied rows arbitrarily, on the
generator's side and here alike. Tied duplicates are interchangeable, so
R's content does not depend on which copy lands at rank n; a collision
straddling rank n could change it, and the digest check — `verified=False`
— is the guard for that and for every other way R can drift (the source
changed before the pin, or could not be pinned at all).
