"""The evaluation plan: everything the Beam job needs to know before it
reads a row, decided from BigQuery metadata and ONE aggregate scan per
table side.

    launch + models ──► tables: launch tables parents first, their
          │             already-landed parents read-only ("external");
          │             a table the loaded model does not declare → PlanError
          │             (R50), unless the launch is that one table → standalone
          │             (R55), or relationships are off (R53)
          ▼
    per launch table: bq.table → resolve_scope (+ foreign writers)
          │           → pin_source → provisional ColumnPlans
          │           → as_of_diff only: its start snapshot (R57)
          ▼
    dry runs (planning SELECTs, panel, prepare DDL and, sampled, the
          │  worst-case sample reads) ─► Budget.check_bytes; a table whose
          │  dry run fails is skipped as scope `unknown`, not the plan
          ▼             nothing billed before this point
    ONE planning SELECT per side → scope.verify(rows) → R/E/H panel
          ▼
    [sampled] a salted sample CTAS per side above sample_rows ─► check again
          ▼
    census shares (fixed shuffle first, the rest max-min fair across
    tables, then columns) → kinds, grids, dictionaries → pairs → digest

Planning SQL, per column (`t` is the read; a key column stops after the
distinct count, a nested one after the null count):

    all          COUNTIF(NULL)            (REPEATED: ARRAY_LENGTH = 0)
    STRING/BYTES COUNTIF(TRIM(x) = '')    (BYTES: LENGTH(x) = 0)
    scalar       APPROX_COUNT_DISTINCT(x)
    numeric,     APPROX_QUANTILES(v, 1000), AVG, STDDEV_POP, MIN, MAX,
    temporal     APPROX_TOP_COUNT(v, 11) (atoms); TIMESTAMP/DATETIME also
                 COUNTIF(TIME(x) = 00:00:00) (day granularity)
    STRING/BYTES AVG(LENGTH(x)), APPROX_TOP_COUNT(x', 255) (dictionaries),
                 x' = x when BYTE_LENGTH(x) <= 1024, else NULL
    BOOL         APPROX_TOP_COUNT(x, 255)

A top list counts NULL as a value, so each asks for one slot more than it
keeps (10 atoms, 254 dictionary values). A value over 1 KiB is never a
category and never enters one: that bounds a top list at 255 * (1 KiB +
16 B) whatever the column holds.

`v` is x on one numeric scale: FLOAT64 with NaN/±Inf as NULL, the other
numerics CAST AS FLOAT64, and temporal values as UNIX_MICROS epochs (DATE
and DATETIME read as UTC; TIME as microseconds since midnight). Every
temporal grid, atom, mean and std in a `ColumnPlan` is on that scale, so
the Beam encoder must encode temporal cells in epoch microseconds too.
BigQuery allows 10 000 output columns per SELECT — counted as leaves, so
a top list's ARRAY<STRUCT<value, count>> is three — about 1 M characters
of query text and a 100 MB result row. `planning_queries` keeps every
SELECT under all three (the row under 90 MB, estimating each top list at
its bound and each quantile grid at 1001 * 8 B): a table past any of them
is planned in several SELECTs over the same read, column groups that never
split a column, each with its own `COUNT(*)`, which must agree. Columnar
billing reads each column once, so the chunks cost what one SELECT would.

Determinism: BigQuery documents APPROX_QUANTILES, APPROX_COUNT_DISTINCT
and APPROX_TOP_COUNT as approximate but says nothing about repeat runs
over identical data. The plan (grids, atoms, dictionaries, kinds, pairs,
census methods — and so `encoding_plan_digest`) may therefore differ
slightly between two plannings of the same data. `evaluation_key` does
not depend on them; metrics are deterministic for a given plan.

STRING routing (source statistics, non-NULL n):

    key (PK / FK column) or identity column   → identifier
    distinct ≤ 1000                            → categorical
    distinct / n ≥ 0.9, AVG(LENGTH) ≥ 20      → text
    distinct / n ≥ 0.9                         → identifier
    otherwise, AVG(LENGTH) ≥ 20               → text
    otherwise                                  → categorical (high cardinality)

Literals (D6): `literal_ok` holds when the source top list covers every
non-NULL row with at most 50 values, each counted at least 10 times (the
list itself is the evidence, not the HLL distinct estimate). A value is
stored literally iff `literal_ok` AND `hash64(name, value)` is in
`detection_dictionary`, which is built from SOURCE values only — a value
only the synthetic side holds is always a hashed label. `dictionary` is
the `hash64` codes of the top-9 source values (the pair grid's 10th cell
is "other"), `detection_dictionary` the top-254 (Ruling R32), most
frequent first, NULL never a value.

Census head (Ruling R67): `census_head` holds the `hash64` codes of the
source's top-254 values followed by the synthetic side's top-254 (each
side's own `APPROX_TOP_COUNT(x', 255)`; duplicates once), for every
non-key STRING, BYTES and BOOL column whatever its routed kind. A
value-sampled census includes these values with certainty (weight 1)
and hash-samples only the tail (weight 1 / rate), a stratified
Horvitz-Thompson design, so a heavy hitter is never left to the hash.
Numeric and temporal columns have no head (their top list is 10 atoms on
the planning scale, not value codes).

Pairs: the `pair_max_columns` pairable columns (numeric, temporal,
categorical, boolean; never a key; ≥ 2 source-distinct values) ranked by
APPROX_COUNT_DISTINCT as an entropy proxy on the 10-cell pair grid —
first by log2(min(distinct, 10)) descending, then by |ln(distinct / 10)|
ascending (a numeric or temporal column fills the grid by deciles, so its
distance is 0), then schema order — and every pair among them.

  skipped with scope status `unknown` and the error as its reason; the
  other tables are still planned. The same holds for a table whose OWN
  metadata is malformed or missing (e.g. a non-numeric `timeTravelHours`):
  `_Planner.locate_table` marks it unreadable and moves on rather than
  letting the `KeyError`/`TypeError`/`ValueError` escape this loop, so a
  later table's bad metadata can never lose an earlier table's
  already-created snapshot (R61).

    BudgetExceededError: the dry runs exceed `max_bytes_billed`;
