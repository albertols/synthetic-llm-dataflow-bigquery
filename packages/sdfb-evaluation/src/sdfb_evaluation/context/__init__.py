"""Small, standalone mirrors of the generator's relationship model and
reference-sample logic.

`sdfb_evaluation` cannot import `sdfb_core`/`sdfb_beam` (it ships and is
tested independently of the generator), so it cannot call the originals
directly. `context.relationships` and `context.reference` reimplement the
slice of their behaviour this package needs, pinned against the originals
by a two-sided golden-file parity test rather than by import — see
`packages/sdfb-evaluation/tests/unit/test_parity_goldens.py` and
`packages/sdfb-tests/tests/unit/evaluation_parity/test_goldens.py`.
