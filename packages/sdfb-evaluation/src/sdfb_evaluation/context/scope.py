"""Which landing rows one generation job wrote, and the source as the job
saw it — planned as SQL, never run here.

Landing rows carry no run id, so one job's rows are recovered from the
launch's write disposition and the job's own commit window (the labelled
`JobWrite`s of `context.jobs`):

    disposition  the job's writes / later writers   mode        what is read
    ───────────  ─────────────────────────────────  ──────────  ─────────────────────
    overwrite    no foreign write after the job     table       the landing table
    overwrite    a foreign write after the job      as_of       snapshot clone AS OF
                                                                the window end
    append       LOAD / DML only                    appends     CTAS over APPENDS(t,
                                                                window start, end)
    append       any COPY job (Beam FILE_LOADS'     as_of_diff  CTAS: t AS OF end
                 multi-partition path)                          minus the start snapshot
    --scope manual                                  manual      the table as it is now

`as_of_diff` exists because BigQuery's documented change-history
operations (CREATE TABLE, INSERT, MERGE, load, streaming) do not list
copy jobs, and Beam lands large writes through temp tables plus COPY
jobs. It is the exact multiset difference of the two states: rows are
numbered within identical `TO_JSON_STRING` groups on both sides
(`ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY TO_JSON_STRING(t))`) and the end-side
`(json, rn)` pairs absent from the start side are kept — so a duplicate
before the window, a duplicate after it and a row re-appended identical
to an existing one all count exactly. It is exact for an append-only
window; a delete or update inside the window shrinks it (the count check
says so).

BigQuery's time-travel rule shapes it: "A single query statement can't
reference a single table at more than one point in time, including the
current time." So it takes two statements, each reading every table at
one point:

    planning_sql  CREATE SNAPSHOT TABLE <start> CLONE t FOR SYSTEM_TIME
    (planner,     AS OF <ws> OPTIONS(24 h)       zero bytes, auto-expiring
     phase A)
    read_expr /   t FOR SYSTEM_TIME AS OF <we>   minus   <start> (read now)
    prepare_sql     one table at we                   another table, now

The start snapshot is the ONE table planning may create (R5 amended by
R57): the scope's `read_expr` reads it, and the planner's dry runs and
planning SELECTs run over that `read_expr`. It is named
`{temp_dataset}.sdfb_eval_{evaluation_id}_start_{short}` and recorded
(`ScopePlan.planning_sql`/`start_table`, the plan's `planning_ddl`). The
difference reads the table and the snapshot once each — about 2x the
table's bytes, which the planner's dry run of the CTAS counts into the
budget. A table created inside the window has no start state to
subtract: it is read AS OF the window end (`as_of`), and the reason says
so.

The window pads the job's own writes by a second on each side, and every
other writer is placed against it:

      now - time_travel_hours + 1 h     ws = first start - 1 s   we = last end + 1 s
    ──────────┬──────────────────────────┬──────── job writes ────────┬──────────►
              │ earlier writers: ignored │ overlapping writers:       │ later writers:
              │ (truncated / outside the │ contaminated — their rows  │ as_of (overwrite),
              │ window)                  │ look like the job's        │ ignored (append)
              └── ws (appends, as_of_diff) or we (as_of) older than this floor → expired

The floor keeps a 1 h safety margin inside the table's time-travel
window: the prepare DDL runs later than planning, and a point that ages
out in between would fail the whole run. A window end after `now` (the
job still writing, or skewed clocks) is `unknown`. A writer overlaps
when its own [start, end] meets [ws, we]: its commit lies somewhere in
that span, so these are exactly the writers whose commit MAY fall in the
window (conservative for an overwrite, where a writer committed before
the truncating first commit is flagged although its rows were removed).

`expired` (time travel can no longer recover the window), `empty` (the
job wrote nothing), a rejected `contaminated` and an `unknown` that
cannot be placed leave nothing to read (`read_table == ""`): the current
table is never read in their place. `--scope manual` is the explicit way
to evaluate the table as it is now.

SQL values. The APPENDS window is bound as `@start_<short>`/`@end_<short>`,
namespaced per table so two tables' read expressions can share one
statement (`ScopePlan.params` carries the values for `prepare_sql` AND
`read_expr`). Every `FOR SYSTEM_TIME AS OF` — the snapshot clone, the
as-of read, both sides of `as_of_diff`, the source pin — carries an RFC
3339 `TIMESTAMP '…'` literal re-rendered from a parsed `datetime`, so
only digits and fixed separators reach the text. Query parameters are
constant expressions and would do there too; the literal is kept for
safety, so that one rendering serves the DDL, the planning reads and the
dry runs, identically to the microsecond.

Temp tables are `{temp_dataset}.sdfb_eval_{evaluation_id}_{side}_{short}`
(`short` = the table id plus an 8-hex digest of the table and the
table's use, so two landing tables named alike, or a scope and a sample
of the same table, never collide) and expire 24 h after creation. The
DDL is a plain `CREATE TABLE`: a retry of the same `evaluation_id`
within those 24 h collides loudly, so every attempt must mint a fresh
`evaluation_id`. The temp dataset must live in the landing/source
table's location. The permissions this needs: on the base (landing or
source) table, `bigquery.tables.get`, `tables.getData`,
`tables.createSnapshot`, `datasets.get` and `jobs.create`; on the temp
dataset, `tables.create` and `tables.updateData`; for the 24 h expiry,
`tables.deleteSnapshot`. Only the predefined `dataOwner`, `admin` or
`studioAdmin` roles can create a snapshot with an expiration time.

The row count read is always checked (`ScopePlan.verify`): against Σ the
job's own committed `output_rows` for the table and, when present, Σ
`validation_runs.valid_count`. A writer with no BigQuery job (a
streaming insert) or run from another project is invisible to
`foreign_writes`; that count check is the only guard there.

M4 live checks (not provable on the laptop):

- `APPENDS` over a LOAD-only window returns exactly the job's rows (the
  count check stays ok), and whether it also returns WRITE_APPEND copy-job
  rows, which are not in its documented operation list;
- `as_of_diff`'s CTAS runs within budget on a large landing table (about
  2x its bytes) and its count matches Σ output_rows;
- the snapshot clone with `OPTIONS(expiration_timestamp=…)` and the
  as-of literal succeed with the evaluator's roles;
- a landing table created by the job (`--create_if_not_exists`) takes
  the `as_of` path via `Bq.table`'s `created`;
- `creationTime` after a CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE (a new table: later than
  the window, so `unknown`) and after a WRITE_TRUNCATE load or copy
  (assumed unchanged — if it moves, as_of_diff windows fall back to
  `as_of` and overwrite windows may read as `unknown`).

      `overwrite`), None when unresolved.
    writes: the job's labelled writes (`writes_by_beam_job`); writes into
      other tables are ignored.
    foreign: other writers into the table (`foreign_writes` from the
      window start, open-ended); earlier ones are ignored.
    expected_rows: Σ `validation_runs.valid_count` for the table, or None.
    requested: `auto` (derive from the disposition and the writes) or a
      mode to force.
    now: the evaluation's clock (RFC 3339 text or a datetime).
    time_travel_hours: the table's own time-travel window (its dataset's
      `max_time_travel_hours`; BigQuery's default is 168).
    temp_dataset: `project.dataset` for the materialized scope.
    evaluation_id: names the temp table (`[A-Za-z0-9_-]`); fresh per

    allow_contaminated: evaluate a contaminated scope anyway; the status
      stays `contaminated` and the reason says so.
    table_created: the landing table's creation time (`Bq.table`'s
      `created`), when known.
