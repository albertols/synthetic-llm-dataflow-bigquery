"""What an evaluation may spend: BigQuery bytes and Beam shuffle.

Two budgets, two different enforcement points:

                                   * rate) * 24 B         rows), both sides;

    null bits    min(rows, 4096) * 16 B                  bounded pattern dict

`MEMBERSHIP_CODE_BYTES` is measured, not assumed: a membership code
crosses the shuffle as 8 B of uint64 plus its count packed to the
smallest unsigned width, inside bundle-merged elements whose per-element
overhead is spread over the bundle's codes of a bucket (FastPrimitivesCoder:
9.0-9.5 B a code with 64 or more rows a bucket in a bundle; 12.4 B for a
lone 8192-row batch at the 10-bit bucket maximum). Every element also
repeats its key `(table, kind, bucket)`, whose table name costs its
length; at worst an element carries a single code, so a code is
budgeted at `MEMBERSHIP_CODE_BYTES + len(table name)` (Ruling R76): an
upper bound, generous for the usual bundle.

The census gets what the fixed parts leave, shared max-min fairly
(`water_fill`): first across tables, then across one table's census
columns, so a column needing little is never sampled to feed one needing
much, and a column expecting at most 1 000 keys is exact whatever is
left. A column granted less than its demand is value-sampled at `K /
10 000` (`VALUE_SAMPLE_MODULUS`): its census head enters with certainty
and, of the other values, only hashes with `hash mod M < K`, which keeps
every retained value's count exact. The mask pass cannot be sampled, so
the planner counts it with the fixed shuffle (`mask_bytes`).
