"""Shared enums and the `MetricValue` / `ProfileValue` records the metric
and profile producers return.

`MetricValue` is the in-memory shape a metric function produces; Task 14's
writer maps its fields onto `evaluation_metrics` rows (see
`src/sdfb_evaluation/schemas/evaluation_metrics.schema.json`). It carries the
raw measurement only — `status` and `score` are derived later from the
catalogue (thresholds, direction) against `value` (or `ci_low` for
`uses_ci_bound` metrics), not stored here. `ProfileValue` is its
`evaluation_profiles` counterpart (`scoring.to_profile_row` writes it).
