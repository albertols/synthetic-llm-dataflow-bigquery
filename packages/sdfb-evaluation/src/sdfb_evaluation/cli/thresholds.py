"""`--thresholds_uri`: a run's own warn and fail thresholds (Ruling
R93-6).

The catalogue owns the default thresholds; a run may override them for
the metrics a YAML file names (a local path or `gs://`):

    thresholds:
      column.ks: {warn: 0.05, fail: 0.10}
      row.coverage: {warn: 0.90, fail: 0.80}

The override holds for the whole run, and nothing grades twice:

    this module            the file, validated before anything starts
          │                (`cli.main`: a bad file is a usage error)
          ▼
    driver.run ─► build_evaluation_pipeline(thresholds=)
          │              ▼
          │       assemble.RowContext ─► scoring.to_metric_row(thresholds=)
          │              ▼
          │       every `evaluation_metrics` row of a named metric: its
          │       status, score, threshold_warn and threshold_fail
          │              ▼
          │       the roll-ups and the registry's counts and scores (they
          │       read the rows), then the --fail_on gate (it reads the
          │       registry's counts)
          ▼
    the registry's `evaluation_params`: `thresholds_uri` and
    `thresholds_digest` (`thresholds_digest` of what the file held), both
    NULL for a run graded by the catalogue alone

An override moves no measured value, so it is not part of the
`evaluation_key`: two runs that differ only in their thresholds are the
same evaluation, told apart by the digest.

What a file may say (anything else is refused, naming the file):

    a metric id            one the packaged catalogue has, and grades: a
                           metric the catalogue only reports (no
                           thresholds of its own) cannot be given a gate
    warn and fail          both, each a finite number, 0 or more
    their order            lower_better and target (thresholds on
                           |value - target|): warn <= fail;
                           higher_better: warn >= fail, and not both 0 —
                           the scorer reads 0 / 0 as the zero-tolerance
                           rule "any value above 0 fails"
