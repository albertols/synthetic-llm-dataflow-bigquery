"""What a finished `sdfb-eval run` exits with (Rulings R88g, R90g, R93).

    exit   meaning
    ────   ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    0      the evaluation finished and no gate tripped
    1      the `--fail_on` gate tripped — and nothing else
    2      a usage error: nothing was started (argparse, `cli.main`)
    3      the evaluation failed: its FINAL row reads FAILED (here), or
           the driver raised (`cli.main` maps that, after the FAILED row)

    FINAL status                 --fail_on none   --fail_on warn | fail
    ───────────────────────────  ───────────────  ─────────────────────────
    FAILED                       3                3
    PARTIAL                      0                1: the gate cannot vouch
                                                  for a launch table that
                                                  was not evaluated
    SKIPPED                      0                0: an empty scope is a
                                                  planned outcome
    SUCCEEDED[_WITH_WARNINGS]    0                by the metric counts:
                                                  fail → any FAIL;
                                                  warn → any WARN or FAIL

A FINAL row can read FAILED without anything having raised: when no
launch table could be evaluated, the pipeline writes that row itself and
ends normally. `final_exit_code` therefore reads the row's status first
— 3 is not a gate and `--fail_on none` does not mask it.

The metric counts are the registry's own (`metrics_fail`, `metrics_warn`
of the FINAL row): the headline counts of the measured rows, aggregate
`*_score` rows excluded.

The gate grades nothing itself. A run under `--thresholds_uri` stores
its statuses already graded against the override (`cli.thresholds`), so
the counts read here are the override's too.
