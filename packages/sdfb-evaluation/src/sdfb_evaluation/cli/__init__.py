"""The `sdfb-eval` command line: `main` parses and dispatches, `driver`
plans and runs one evaluation (registry events around the pipeline),
`planview` prints a plan, `gate` turns a finished run into an exit code,
`fixture` plans rows from JSON files offline, and `run_evaluation` is
the Dataflow flex-template entry.
