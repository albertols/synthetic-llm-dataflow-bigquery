    the wait raised and the run, looked at        the pipeline's FINAL

                                                  polling error is a
                                                  warning and the driver
                                                  reads the row back as
                                                  usual; an interrupt
                                                  writes nothing and says
                                                  how to read the result
    the read-back itself failed                   none: a FINAL row may
                                                  well exist

A submitted job is one that outlives the driver: its result names a job
id (Dataflow). While it is not known to be terminal — an unreadable
state counts as running — the driver writes no terminal row: it prints
the job id and how to read the result later, and re-raises. A local run
(no job id) dies with the driver, so the driver closes it. A submitted
job that ended in a state other than DONE may have loaded its FINAL row
first, so the driver reads the registry back before it appends FAILED
and appends nothing when a FINAL row is there, or when the read-back
itself fails (Ruling R113).

A template launch hands the job over instead of submitting it: with
`--template_location` — which is how a flex-template launcher runs the
entry — Beam's DataflowRunner returns a result with no job (`has_job`
false, and a `job_id()` that raises). There is no job id and nothing to
wait for: the driver leaves its RUNNING row for the job to close and
ends 0, whether or not it was asked to wait (Ruling R113). Two
contradicting terminal rows are worse than a RUNNING row that stays open
(an orchestrator's failure callback closes that one). For the same
reason a run found DONE is never closed by the driver on the strength of
a failed wait: FAILED is appended to a DONE run only after a read-back
that worked and found no FINAL row.

Every exception is re-raised after its row, never replaced; a FAILED row
that cannot itself be written is reported on stderr and the original
error still surfaces. `sdfb-eval run` waits, so its exit code can carry
the `--fail_on` gate; the flex-template entry submits the Dataflow job
and returns.

Not every FAILED comes with an exception: when no launch table could be
evaluated the pipeline itself writes a FINAL row reading FAILED and ends
normally. The driver reads the FINAL row back anyway — the gate needs
its counts — and a FAILED one exits 3 (`cli.gate.final_exit_code`), with
no second row.

Runner defaults: the DirectRunner evaluates samples and loads through
the client (`--mode sampled --sink bq_client`); Dataflow reads every row
and writes from the pipeline (`--mode exact --sink bq`). The pipeline
options come from `pipeline_options_defaults(runner, prepared plan)` —
the side-input cache is sized from the plan that will actually run, and
the RUNNER is the one it returns: `--runner DirectRunner` is what the
operator says and the registry records, while the pipeline runs on
Beam's in-process `FnApiRunner` (Beam's own `DirectRunner` hands a batch
pipeline to Prism, which `build_evaluation_pipeline` refuses). Every
`PipelineOptions` here is built over the explicit list of Beam arguments
the operator gave, never over `sys.argv` — with those arguments
underneath the defaults: their experiments are
kept, `upload_graph` is always among them on Dataflow, and
`enable_data_sampling` is refused (it would sample the label key into
the monitoring UI, Ruling R68).

The label key is never read here: `--label_key_uri` travels into the
plan, a worker resolves it, the registry records only `operator` or
`ephemeral`, and nothing this module prints or writes names the URI (an
error message that quotes it is redacted before the registry's
1,000-character cut). A reason that is cut keeps, after its beginning,
the line on which Beam names the failing step (else its last line).

`--thresholds_uri` (`cli.thresholds`, Ruling R93-6): the overrides the
file held arrive validated in `args.thresholds`. They go to the
pipeline, which grades and stores every metric row under them, and the
plan — so every registry row, a FAILED one included — records the URI
(a `gs://` one as given, any other only as its file's base name) and the
overrides' digest in `evaluation_params`. The gate is unchanged:
it reads the registry's counts, which are counts of the stored rows.

The free-text pools (`field.pool_memorization_lift`) are read here, per
table, from the launch's `freetext_pools_table`. A read BigQuery REFUSES
(`context.bq.is_refusal`) degrades with a warning; a transient error
fails the run, as in `prepare_evaluation` (Ruling R89, M8).

`--sink bq_client` without `--output_local` writes under a temporary
directory: removed when the run ends without an error, kept (its path
printed once on stderr) when it failed after writing something.

`plan` builds the same plan and stops. Planning itself creates one kind
of table (Ruling R57): the zero-byte, 24-hour start snapshot of an
`as_of_diff` scope, because the scope's reads go through it. With
`--no_planning_snapshots` the planner is handed a BigQuery that refuses
every DDL statement, so nothing is created and each such table is
planned as scope `unknown` with that reason — unplanned.
