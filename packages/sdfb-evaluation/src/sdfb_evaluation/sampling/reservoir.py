"""A deterministic, mergeable bottom-k sampler: `priority` assigns every
key a pseudo-random `uint64` rank from a salt, and `BottomK` keeps the `k`
smallest `(priority, key)` pairs seen so far, together with each retained
key's exact multiplicity (Ruling R34).

This is coordinated/bottom-k sampling (Cohen, 1997; Cohen & Kaplan, 2007):
because `priority` is a pure function of `(salt, key)`, the same key always
gets the same rank everywhere it is computed — on any worker, in any run,
with the same salt — so two samples drawn this way agree on every key they
share (Task 24 relies on exactly this: sampling synthetic rows by a row-hash
key so a row that also exists in the source draws the same priority as its
source twin). `BottomK` is also mergeable: the true bottom-k of a union of
streams is always contained in the union of each stream's own bottom-k (an
item outside a stream's local bottom-k already has `k` smaller items from
that stream alone, so it cannot be in the global bottom-k either), which is
what makes `merge` exact, pure and independent of how work was partitioned.

`BottomK` maintains its own indexed binary max-heap on `(priority, key)`
(rather than delegating to `heapq`) plus a `key -> heap index` map kept
correct through every swap, so that re-adding an already-held key — the
common case once a table has duplicate/memorized rows, since `priority` is
a pure function of the key and so always recomputes the SAME priority for
it — resolves in O(1) instead of an O(k) scan for the held entry.

  """The `k` smallest `(priority, key)` pairs seen by `add`/`merge`, each

  Ties on `priority` are broken by `key` (both are plain integers, so the
  order is total and needs no randomness); a `key` added more than once —
  which, since `priority` is a pure function of `(salt, key)`, normally
  means the same priority reaching `add` twice with two different payloads
  — resolves via `_resolve_duplicate` rather than either occupying its own
  slot or letting arrival order decide, and increments that key's held
  count (Ruling R34) rather than discarding the observation.

  `k` must be non-negative; `k = 0` is a valid, permanently empty sampler
  (every `add` is then a no-op).

  Exact multiplicity (Ruling R34): a key retained at the end was admitted
  on its very first `add` and never evicted afterwards, in every stream
  that ever fed this structure (directly or through a `merge`). Proof: the
  admission threshold — the current worst `(priority, key)` among the held
  entries once the heap is full — only ever falls (an `add` only replaces
  the worst entry with a strictly smaller candidate) or is undefined
  (heap not yet full, everything is admitted). So once a key is rejected
  or evicted at some threshold, it stays rejected at every later, stricter
  threshold; a key retained at the end can therefore never have been
  rejected or evicted along the way. That means every `add` for a
  currently-held key really is another sighting of the SAME key (not a
  competing candidate that happens to share a slot), so incrementing its
  count on each such `add` — and summing counts for a key held by both
  operands of a `merge` — gives its exact total multiplicity across the
  full input, not merely a lower bound.
