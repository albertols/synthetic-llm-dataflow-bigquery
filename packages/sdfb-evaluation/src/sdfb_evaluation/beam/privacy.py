Sampling. Both sides are sampled by the same pure priority of the row
hash (`beam.encode`: salted, over every plan column), so a row the
synthetic side copies whole draws its source twin's priority
(coordinated bottom-k; Cohen & Kaplan, 2007). `sampling.reservoir.
BottomK` keeps the k smallest priorities with each key's EXACT
multiplicity (Ruling R34; the tie-break of two payloads under one key is
their canonical JSON, R35). The priority is SplitMix64's finaliser of
the row hash XOR a salt word (Steele, Lea & Flood, 2014): vectorised,
and a pure function of (salt, key), which is all BottomK's exactness
needs. Before any row reaches Python, a batch keeps only the rows whose
priority lies below q · 2^64, q = min(1, (2k + 100) / K), where K is a
LOWER bound of the distinct keys a side reads: the smaller of the
plan's rows read and the largest planned distinct count
(APPROX_COUNT_DISTINCT) of any of its columns — a row hash is at least
as distinct as each of its cells. Each key passes with probability q,
so about 2k + 100 keys pass and the BottomK holds the true bottom-k of
keys, while the shuffle carries about 2k payloads per side instead of
up to k per bundle. A bound on ROWS would not do: on a key-less table
whose whole rows repeat (a few hundred keys over millions of rows) it
lets a few dozen keys through, and every sample drawn from them is a
cluster sample (Ruling R85). Because the rate is per key, one key
holding more than half of a side's rows no longer shortens the sample
(under a rate on rows, it passed with probability q alone and the
other keys could fall below k). Two exceptions remain:

  - planned counts that overstate the keys actually read — a stale plan
    (rows or distinct counts far above what is read; no row passing at
    all is reported as such), or a sampled-mode read, which holds fewer
    distinct values than the full table the plan counted (the factor 2
    absorbs down to half of them);
  - the binomial tail itself, beyond ~sqrt(k / 2) standard deviations.

Either leaves the sample SHORT: fewer than k keys held although some of
the side's rows were left out (held rows < rows read) — which covers
every sample holding fewer than min(k, rows read) rows. A short sample
is still an equal-probability sample of keys; every row computed from
it carries `detail.sample_short = true` and `sample_short_counts` (that
side's held keys and rows, rows read and k). Every occurrence of a key
shares its priority, so the prefilter keeps or drops all its copies
together and the multiplicities stay exact.

Weights. The synthetic rows the privacy metrics see are the sampled keys
in priority order, each repeated by its multiplicity, cut at
`privacy_sample_rows` rows (the last key partly): every key equally
likely, its copies kept together — a cluster sample of rows (below).
Distances are computed once
per key and repeated by its weight, so a row held c times weighs c, not
1 (R34). The holdout share is rebuilt from the pooled nearest-neighbour
masses, `nn_mass[:n].sum() / n_syn` (R29, whose `permutation_se` assumes
|R| = |H| = n); NNMerge sorts by the priority rank, so no result
depends on arrival order.

Row samples (Ruling R85). A PREFIX of the multiplicity-expanded keys is
a cluster sample: on a key-less table where whole rows repeat, its
first rows are a few heavy keys with all their copies (coverage 0.2 to
0.6 for a faithful generator where a row sample reads 1.0). The holdout
share and the p5 ratios keep that validated path — `permutation_se` is
the exact split variance given the clusters — but density and coverage
draw a SYSTEMATIC PPS sample over EVERY held key in priority order
(Madow, 1949): with T the held rows (the sum of the
multiplicities) and n the rows wanted, points start + j·T/n (j < n),
start from the salt in [0, T/n), each select the key whose cumulative
row interval holds them, so every held row is drawn with probability
n / T and a key appears about c·n/T times. The priority order is a
random order of the keys, so the points spread over them as a random
start would; the draw is a pure function of the sample and the salt.
It gives density and coverage their min(|R|, n_syn) rows at equal n
(D5), against R's first rows (`density_sample`).

Detection draws its rows on each side (`detection_view`, and the
thinning to equal n and to |R| for the baseline) as a SIMPLE RANDOM
sample of the held rows without replacement instead — n distinct row
positions out of T from a salt-seeded generator (Floyd's algorithm in
numpy), each mapped to its key — which is equally an equal-probability
row sample. Systematic PPS fixes each repeated key's count to the floor
or ceiling of c·n/T on BOTH sides, and the classifier's
cross-validation then scores such exactly balanced duplicates below
chance (each held-out fold sees the other class over-represented in its
training folds): on a key-less Zipf table of 200 whole-row patterns a
faithful generator read an AUC of 0.37 and a baseline of 0.45, against
0.50 for independent simple random samples (six seeds). A simple random
sample keeps the multinomial variation a row sample has, so the null
AUC sits at 0.5.

The feature space is the plan's (`stats.privacy.GowerSpace`): the
non-key numeric and temporal columns through their SOURCE quantile grid
(UNIX microseconds for temporal columns, Ruling R54), the non-key
categorical, boolean, text and identifier columns as `hash64` codes. Keys
(primary, foreign and identity columns) and nested columns are never
features — the membership pass's "content". A numeric column the plan
holds no source grid for (an all-NULL source column) is left out and
named in `detail.excluded`. The encoder reads an absent column as NULL,
so every panel row must carry every plan column: a row that does not is
refused with the column names, never read as NULL.

R and H (the panel, D3) arrive as a side input (`PanelInputs`, with the
Gower space), are encoded once per worker behind
`apache_beam.utils.shared.Shared` — on the first `process()` call, since
a side input cannot be read in `setup()` — and the index is kept alive
by the DoFn. The five row metrics are `not_evaluated`, with the reason,
when the panel is missing, not verified (`UNVERIFIED_REASON`: R is not
known to be what the generator read), |R| ≠ |H| (the holdout test and
its permutation variance need equal halves), or R or H holds fewer than
`MIN_PANEL_ROWS`. A 5th-percentile ratio whose holdout percentile is 0 —
holdout rows duplicating reference records, as on a lattice — is
`not_evaluated` (`HOLDOUT_P5_ZERO`, `HOLDOUT_NNDR_P5_ZERO`), never +inf.
`baseline_value` (D4) of density and coverage is R read as the synthetic
side against H as the real one, at the same n.

Detection runs on ONE element per table (both samples), on one worker.
`featurize` reads the payload cells exactly as it reads the client's
rows: numeric and temporal cells as the encoder's floats (micros),
booleans as `bool`, strings as the text block holds them (`hash64`
canonicalises BYTES and its base64 text alike). Keys (primary and foreign)
are never features; identity columns are text features. A text or
identifier column's head masks are the SOURCE sample's `shape_of` masks
holding at least 2 % of its non-empty values (ADR 0026's floor), most
frequent first — never the synthetic side's. Memory: each side's
sample is cut to its `detection_sample_rows`-row `RowSample` BEFORE the
two meet (`ToDict`), so the element holds at most that many keys a side
as Python tuples (about 60 B a cell), plus
the float64 feature matrix of 2n x F features (F = numeric + categorical
+ 7 per text column; 40 MB at n = 50,000 and F = 50), the gradient
boosting's binned copy (uint8, an eighth of it) and the logistic design
(CSR) — well under a gigabyte at the defaults. `baseline_value` is the
same test with R in the synthetic class (D4) against the source rows
thinned to |R| (`detail.baseline_n`): it is at n = |R|, not at the
metric's n, so it is a floor to read, not a matched comparison (a D5
note for the design doc). `table.pmse_ratio` always
carries `detail["ceiling"]` = N / (k - 1) (R33: scoring marks it
not_evaluated when the ceiling sits below the fail threshold). The seed
is a function of the salt.

Flags carry keys only, never an attribute value (D6, R64/R68):

    nearest_record   the synthetic rows nearest to a reference record,
                     ascending Gower distance (priority order breaks
                     ties); `source_key_hash` is the keyed label of the
                     matched R record's code (its PK hash, else identity
                     hash, else its record hash), `distance`/`score = 1 -
                     distance`; detail: holdout distance, NNDR,
                     multiplicity
    detectable       only when the AUC reaches the catalogue's warn
                     threshold AND its DeLong ci_low clears 0.5 (the
                     examples a WARN or FAIL explains; DeLong treats
                     repeated rows as independent, so ci_low alone
                     clears 0.5 by chance on a faithful key-less table):
                     the synthetic rows the classifier scores most surely
                     synthetic (out of fold), one per sampled key;
                     `score` = that probability

`synthetic_key` is the synthetic row's PK tuple, else its identity tuple
(the membership convention; NULL for a table with neither). At most
`row_flags_top_k` of each.

Sampled mode (Ruling R72). Every metric here is a sample estimate
(`method = sample`; `sample_rate` = the share of the synthetic table the
metric saw, the sampled-mode read rate included). None needs every row
of a side, so none is withheld; the read rate is also in
`detail.sample_rate`, as the membership pass writes it.

Failures stay per table and per block. A table whose spec cannot be
built on the driver (`TABLE_ERRORS`) writes `not_evaluated` rows with
the reason for every owned id; a Gower space that cannot be built, or a
worker's data error (`WORKER_ERRORS`) in the sampling (both blocks) or
the nearest-neighbour search (privacy only), makes those metrics
`not_evaluated` with the reason and drops their flags; the other block,
tables and the run carry on. A worker's `MemoryError` is not a data
error: it is raised, so the bundle fails and the runner retries it — a
privacy block lost to memory must not leave the run SUCCEEDED (Ruling
R113).
