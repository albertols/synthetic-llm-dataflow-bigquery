"""Relational integrity and fan-out: for every foreign-key edge
`child(cols) → parent(ref_cols)`, on the source side and on the synthetic
side, the orphan rate and the children-per-parent distribution.

The join switch. A CoGroupByKey shuffles both sides by key; a parent side
small enough to broadcast is cheaper as a side input, joined map-side:

    parent rows on that side (TablePlan.rows_read,      join
      sampling applied; rows ≥ distinct keys)
    ─────────────────────────────────────────────────   ──────────────────
    ≤ SIDE_INPUT_MAX_KEYS (10 M)                        side input: a
                                                        sorted uint64 set,
                                                        8 B a key (≤ 80 MB),
                                                        np.searchsorted
                                                        over the child
                                                        counts; the parent
                                                        keys are never
                                                        shuffled by key
    > 10 M, or unknown — a read-only (`external`)       CoGroupByKey
      parent is never counted at planning

Both paths feed the same FanoutAcc and give identical metrics (a test
pins it). A parent side above the bound would make every worker hold the
whole set, so it shuffles instead. Sizing the side-input cache to the
sets broadcast (8 B a parent key, from the planned rows) is Task 26's
job; here a runtime guard fails an edge (not_evaluated, with the reason)
whose parent set holds more than twice the rows its plan expects — the
plan, and the cache sized from it, no longer describe the data.

Counting. Every parent is a DISTINCT non-NULL referenced key tuple
(`parents`): a key held by several parent rows (a duplicate in a non-PK
`ref_cols`) is one parent, and `parent_rows - parents` is reported; a
parent row whose key has a NULL part is no parent (`parent_null_keys`),
not a childless one. A child tuple is `matched` when a parent holds its
key, an `orphan`
otherwise, a `null_key` when any part is NULL. The fan-out of a parent is
its matched children (0 when none): the histogram, TVD, W1, the
childless share, adherence and coverage read those. The mean ratio does
not (Ruling R82): it is the catalogue formula over ROWS,

    FMR = (n_child / n_parent)_syn / (n_child / n_parent)_src
    n_child   every child row read — matched, orphaned, NULL-keyed
    n_parent  every parent row read — a NULL-part key included

so a source with 100 of its 400 orders NULL-keyed (guest checkouts)
against a synthetic side with none scores 1.0, and extra NULL-keyed or
orphaned synthetic child rows move it (matched-only means would read
4/3 and 1.0 there). A parent row sample at rate r scales a side's rows
per parent by 1/r; the ratio is evaluated only when both parent sides
share one rate (they cancel), `not_evaluated` otherwise.

Documented edges (`enforced: false`, Ruling R42): every row is emitted
exactly as on an enforced edge, with `detail["enforced"]` for the
pipeline to pass to `scoring.to_metric_row(enforced=…)` — the scorer
reports only the orphan rate as INFO; the fan-out metrics stay graded.
The source's own orphan rate is the synthetic row's `source_value`.

Fewer than k parents (Ruling R83, k = RARE_COUNT = 10, the R80.3 rule
for relations): when either side holds fewer than k distinct parent keys,
every fan-out metric is `not_evaluated` with "fewer than k parents on a
side (k = 10)" and publishes no mean, no `children_*`/`parents_*` detail:
a fan-out over a handful of parents is theirs (one parent's IS its
count). The orphan rows stay evaluated — an integrity verdict must hold
on every edge — without their parent counts; their rate and n still
give the matched total, which below k bounds those few parents' summed
fan-out (accepted for the integrity gate).

Extremes (R65, R71): an exact min or max fan-out is one parent's count,
so no detail publishes one (nor an overflow mean, which can be a single
parent's); `cardinality_adherence` uses them internally only. Its
adherent count (adherence * n_synthetic) can still pin max_src when
fan-outs are dense integers — accepted and documented, as R65 accepts
the same channel for `field.range_adherence`.

A missing source twin (Ruling R84): a read-only parent whose
`<source dataset>.<name>` does not exist, or a launch parent with no
source table, leaves only the metrics that need the source side
`not_evaluated` (the source orphan rate and the six fan-out metrics);
the synthetic orphan rate is still measured against the parent's
landing table.

Sampled mode (Ruling R72, as in `beam.membership`): a side whose plan
rate is below 1 was read as a row sample. A metric that needs every row
of a side it reads is `not_evaluated` with "sampled mode cannot measure
…; run exact mode" and the observed lower bounds in `detail`, each named
`*_lower_bound`:

                                 both sides              scales rows per
                                                         parent by 1/r

                                                         source's range

A parent row sample alone leaves each sampled parent's fan-out exact, so
the fan-out shape stays evaluated there, with `method` = sample and the
parent rate as `sample_rate`.

Failures stay per edge (`TABLE_ERRORS`, as in `beam.membership`): an
edge whose spec cannot be built or whose parent cannot be read on the
driver, or whose keys raise a data error on a worker, writes
`not_evaluated` rows with the reason for every owned id; the other edges
and the pipeline carry on. Nothing is dropped silently: an unreadable
side, an unknown parent and a skipped child table are all
`not_evaluated` rows with a reason.
