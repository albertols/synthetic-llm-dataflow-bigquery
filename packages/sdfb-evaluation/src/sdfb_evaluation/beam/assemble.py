"""What the composed pipeline writes, as pure functions: the registry's
lifecycle rows, the run status, the metric rows the transforms do not own
and the roll-up rows.

The registry is append-only events (D7):

    driver ──► running_row(plan)            event RUNNING, status RUNNING
                  │  (DirectRunner/ClientLoadSinks: loaded before the
                  │   pipeline; Dataflow: written before it is launched)
    pipeline ─► metric / profile / flag sinks ──► load AND copy jobs done
                  │                      (their job-id PCollections, read
                  ▼                       as AsIter side inputs)
               final_event(...)          event FINAL, recorded after them
    driver ──► failed_row(plan, exc)     event FINAL, status FAILED, on any
                                         exception (then it re-raises)

    status                   when
    ───────────────────────  ─────────────────────────────────────────────
    SKIPPED                  no launch table can be evaluated (the plan's
                             `skip_reason`; `registry_seed`'s FINAL row)
    FAILED                   the driver caught an exception (`failed_row`:
                             no counts, no scores); or the pipeline ran
                             but could evaluate NONE of the launch tables
                             the plan meant it to (each failed on the
                             driver or on a worker): the FINAL row keeps
                             its counts — every row not_evaluated — and
                             names each table's reason in `warnings`
    PARTIAL                  a launch table was not evaluated (skipped at
                             planning, unreadable or failing in the
                             pipeline) while another was, a scope count
                             mismatch, or a reference panel absent or
                             unverified (its privacy block not evaluated)
    SUCCEEDED_WITH_WARNINGS  otherwise, with warnings (contaminated,
                             expired or unknown scopes, fallbacks, …)
    SUCCEEDED                otherwise

PARTIAL means a launch table or a whole metric block (the privacy panel)
was not evaluated for a plan/driver-level reason, or — with every table
evaluated — a scope `count_mismatch` (the table above lists both): the plan skipped the
table or has no verified panel for it, the driver could not set the
table up, or the pipeline's own encode step failed its rows (the whole
table then, by `guarded`). Transform-internal not_evaluated rows — a
table or metric that Membership, Privacy or Relational could not compute
and reported itself, as `not_evaluated` rows with the reason — show in
the `metrics_not_evaluated` count only and do not change the status.

A status describes the RUN, never the data: a FAIL metric leaves it
SUCCEEDED (the counts and scores carry the verdict). Every row records
`evaluation_params.label_key_mode` (operator | ephemeral, R64; never the
key or its URI) and `evaluation_params.planning_ddl` (the as_of_diff
start snapshots planning created, R57/R58; the plan's warnings name them
too). A FINAL row's `recorded_at` is its finish time, strictly after the
RUNNING row's (`evaluation_latest` orders by it).

Metric rows the transforms do not own:

    table.row_count_ratio       n_syn / n_expected per evaluated table
                                (the scope's Σ valid_count, else the
                                job's own committed output rows)
    column.source_stats_drift   the generator's source_table_stats row vs
                                the evaluator's dense SOURCE profile
                                (Ruling R62), below
    a failed table's rows       every catalogue id the transforms own and
                                the drift, per applicable column / pair,
                                not_evaluated with the failure (driver-side
                                failures; `guarded` rewrites a worker
                                failure's rows)
    roll-ups                    table.{family}_score, table.overall_score,
                                table.column_shape_score,
                                table.pair_trend_score and model.* from the
                                scored rows (`scoring.aggregate_scores`,
                                Ruling R11); `headline_counts` leaves them
                                out (R43)

Determinism, and what a row is graded on (Ruling R89). The same plan
and rows give byte-identical metric and profile rows. Integer counts
merge exactly, but Moments and co-moments merge in floating point in the
order the runner chooses (bundles, `BatchElements`' timing-sized batches,
hot-key fan-out), so a rerun differs in the last ulps: up to about 1e-11
relative where a small delta cancels two near-equal correlations
(measured on the acceptance run). What is written is therefore rounded —
and rounded FIRST, so that nothing is graded on a value the row does not
hold:

    MetricValue ─► stable_metric ─► checked_ci ─► scoring.to_metric_row
                   (round what is    (a reversed    (status and score read
                    persisted)        interval is    the rounded fields;
                                      no interval)   nothing rounds after)

    stable_metric rounds   value, source_value, synthetic_value,
                           baseline_value, noise_floor, ci_low, ci_high,
                           sample_rate and every float of `detail`
                           (`detail.ceiling` gates table.pmse_ratio)
    to                     `STABLE_DIGITS` = 9 significant digits
    and never finer than   `STABLE_FLOOR` = 1e-10 absolute (every
                           catalogue threshold is 1e-5 or more), so the
                           merge noise around an exact 0 is 0 — EXCEPT an
                           integrity-family metric and a count-derived
                           rate (value_kind share or count), which keep
                           no absolute floor: a count over a count is
                           exact and has no merge noise to hide, and one
                           orphan in 3e10 rows must persist as > 0 beside
                           its FAIL

A persisted row scored again from its own fields gives the same status
and score when its auxiliary fields are finite (a non-finite float is
stored as null AFTER scoring, so such a row re-scores from less than
it was scored on); the acceptance re-scores every row it writes; `score` is the
score function of the rounded fields, written as computed. The registry's
`overall_score`, `{family}_score` and `tables[].table_score` are rounded
as their roll-up rows are (`model.*`, `table.overall_score`), so the two
agree. A value whose merge noise straddles a rounding boundary can still
differ between reruns — and with it, now consistently, its status when
the boundary is a threshold — with a probability of about the noise over
the step (1e-6 relative noise … 1e-4 for the micro-epoch means), not the
ulp noise of every value.

Profile payloads (`stable_profile`) round only what the moments make:
`moments.{mean, std, skewness, kurtosis_excess}` and `corr_matrix.values`.
Histogram edges are the plan's grid, quantiles and bounds are read off
exact counts on that grid, counts and count ratios are exact: they
persist as computed, so edges stay strictly increasing at any offset
(epoch seconds, ids near 1e12) and still hash to the row's
`edges_digest`.

`checked_ci` treats a producer's reversed interval (ci_low > ci_high, a
producer defect) as no interval at all before scoring: the bounds are
dropped (reported in `detail.ci_reported`) and `detail.ci_invalid` says
why, so the D5 coverage test answers `noise_check: unavailable` instead
of reading the reversed bounds, and a metric that gates on its bound is
`not_evaluated` instead of gated on a bound that is wrong (Task 14
review). A relationship row passes its edge's `detail["enforced"]` to
`to_metric_row` (Ruling R42).

source_stats_drift (Ruling R62). The driver reads the generator's rows
for (source table, reference digest, tier) once, behind an injectable
query (`read_source_stats`), keeps only the NULL fraction, the distinct
count and the nine inner deciles per column (never a top value or an
extreme), and each column's row compares them with the evaluator's own
dense profile of the source:

    component      compared with                        when
    ─────────────  ───────────────────────────────────  ──────────────────
    null           |p_null(stats) - p_null(source)|     always
    deciles        max_i dist(i/10, [F⁻(d_i), F(d_i)])  numeric columns the
                   — where the evaluator's exact source  generator gave
                   CDF puts the generator's i-th decile  deciles and the
                                                         plan gave a grid
    distinct       |d_stats - d_src| / max(d_stats,     tier `exact` only
                   d_src), d_src the plan's source      (a `sample` tier's
                   distinct less the empty string       distinct is bounded
                                                        by its sample)

The value is the largest available component (the catalogue's formula).
With no stats (tier off, no stats table, no reference digest, no row, a
read BigQuery refused) every column is not_evaluated with the reason; a
read error a retry may remove fails the run instead (`read_source_stats`).
