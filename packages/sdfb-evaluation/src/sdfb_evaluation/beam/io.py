                       registry (evaluation_data_history) last

The read table of each side is materialised before the pipeline runs (the
CLI executes `EvaluationPlan.prepare_sql`, Ruling R5): the pinned source
clone and the scope or sample table, both plain tables DIRECT_READ can
read.

DIRECT_READ types. The encoder hashes canonical values, so a cell must
reach it with the Python type the BigQuery client gives the same cell —
the client is what reads the R/H panel (`context.reference.fetch_panel`)
and what the generator read its reference sample with
(`sdfb_beam.io.bq_sources.load_reference_rows`). Beam 2.74's
`_CustomBigQueryStorageSource` reads Avro through fastavro by default and
Arrow (`read_arrow`, each cell `.as_py()`) with `use_native_datetime=True`:

    BigQuery type    client (panel)       Arrow DIRECT_READ     Avro DIRECT_READ    paged read
    ───────────────  ───────────────────  ────────────────────  ──────────────────  ──────────

    DATE, TIME       date, time           date, time            date, time          = client
    NUMERIC          Decimal              Decimal, scale 9      Decimal, scale 9    = client
    BIGNUMERIC       Decimal              Decimal, scale 38     Decimal, scale 38   = client
    BYTES            bytes                bytes                 bytes               = client
    JSON             parsed value         JSON text ◄ fixed     JSON text ◄ fixed   = client
    GEOGRAPHY        WKT text             WKT text              WKT text            = client
    RECORD, ARRAY    dict, list           dict, list            dict, list          = client

Decimal scale needs no fix (`canonical_value` strips trailing zeros). Arrow
is chosen because it types DATETIME natively at every depth, RECORD
sub-fields included; `normalize_direct_read` fixes the top-level JSON (and,
should an Avro read ever feed it, DATETIME text) by the plan's `bq_type`.
Known limits, all on types the generator does not write or nests: a JSON
sub-field inside a RECORD stays text, and INTERVAL (client `relativedelta`,
Arrow `MonthDayNano`) and RANGE are not normalised — rows holding them hash
differently on the panel and DIRECT_READ sides. The paged read has none of
these limits: its cells are decoded by the code that decodes the panel's.
A table with one side paged and the other read by DIRECT_READ therefore
differs between its sides only on those same limits.

The paged read. DIRECT_READ needs `bigquery.readsessions.create` on the
project of every table it reads, and a project may refuse it (a
deployment that does not grant the role; a public project, where the
caller is expected to hold no role — expected, not observed). The driver
asks once per such project before the graph is built
(`probe_direct_read`, the call a worker makes when it splits the read),
and one rule follows (`RoutedBigQuerySources.paged`): A READ TABLE IS
PAGED IF AND ONLY IF ITS PROJECT REFUSED. Every other read table keeps
DIRECT_READ. The paged read needs `bigquery.tables.get` (the table's
metadata) and `bigquery.tables.getData` (its rows) on the read table,
and no read session:

    Create([read table])
      │ Ranges   NOW (the read table is built by the prepare statements,
      │          after planning): tables.get → numRows, numBytes,
      │          lastModifiedTime, and ONE tabledata.list request for
      │          one row → totalRows, the count the row positions
      │          address → row ranges (start, count) holding about
      │          RANGE_BYTES each
      ▼
    Reshuffle    the ranges spread over the workers
      ▼
    Page         per range: tabledata.list(startIndex = position,
      │          maxResults = rows left, selectedFields = plan columns),
      │          ONE response per request — the API cuts a response at
      │          its byte limit, so the next request starts at
      │          position + rows returned, never at a page token
      ▼
    rows ──► the same PCollection[dict] DIRECT_READ gives, in the
             client's types (the table above)

A range is only the rows it claims on a table that does not change, so
the read fails the job (`TableChangedError`, naming the table and both
readings) instead of reading a changing table wrong:

    the cut            the metadata's `numRows` is `tabledata.list`'s
                       `totalRows`. A table is empty only when the list
                       says so: metadata counting no row is still asked
    every response     it carries a `totalRows` (one that does not
                       fails: it cannot be checked), and that is the row
                       count of the cut
    every range        returns exactly its row count; then tables.get
                       again: the row count and the modification time of
                       the cut. The check runs inside the bundle that
                       emitted the range's rows, so a range that fails
                       it commits none of them
    after the last     the rows the ranges emitted (each range counts
      range            what it yields) add up to the cut, and the
                       table's metadata is still the cut's

Metadata that says nothing never passes for an answer: without a
`numRows` the count is the list's own and one WARNING names the table;
without a `lastModifiedTime` the check for a rewrite with as many rows
is off for that table, and one WARNING says so.

What the checks cannot see: a table whose rows changed ORDER while its
row count and modification time did not. The source pin and the sample
tables are immutable; the landing table of a `table` / `manual` scope
and an unpinned source are live tables.

Throttling. `tabledata.list` has a byte quota per project (3.7 GB of row
data per minute, 7.5 GB in the US and EU multi-regions), charged to the
project that CONTAINS THE TABLE and shared with every other reader of
that project and with `jobs.getQueryResults`. A page
BigQuery throttles waits and is asked for again (`page_retry_waits`: by
the error's REASON — `rateLimitExceeded`, `quotaExceeded`, a backend
error — or a transient transport error; never on a 403 alone, so a
missing permission fails at once), with exponential back-off up to
PAGE_RETRY_MAXIMUM_SECONDS between attempts, for PAGE_RETRY_SECONDS in
all: long enough to ride out a per-minute limit the job's own readers
keep hitting, short enough that a quota waiting does not bring back (a
daily or custom one) fails the range, naming the reason, in minutes.
