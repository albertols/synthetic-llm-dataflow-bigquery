The per-column combines keep Beam's combiner lifting (a column is a hot
key; lifting sends one partial accumulator per bundle).

`counts6` = (c_src, c_syn, c_src_m, c_syn_m, c_src_r, flags): full-n
counts, matched-n counts (`subsample_m`, R59: only the n-dependent
diversity metrics read them), the source count inside a Bernoulli
subsample matched to |R| rows (the entropy/distinct baselines, D4), and
bit 0 = the value is NOT substantive (empty after trim, or a
0001-/9999- date sentinel — the probe's rule). The FlatMap the brief
draws before the pre-aggregation DoFn is fused into it (`accumulate`
counts a batch with numpy and folds it into the bundle dict), so no
per-value element is emitted before the dict has merged the batch.
Nulls are never keys.

Side inputs:

    totals    the dense pass's per-(table, side) accumulators (Task 21),
              slimmed to non-null / matched non-null / non-empty counts
              per plan column: the exact denominators of p, q and the
              shape shares, known before the census has summed anything
    refs      per census column, from the R/H panel (D3), built on the
              driver: R value counts, H/E/H_E value sets, R masks and
              the free-text pool (`census_refs`)
    coverage  the first pass's Chao-Shen sample coverage (Ruling R3; an
              exact census only)

Value sampling (`census: value_sampled`, rate = K / M with M =
`VALUE_SAMPLE_MODULUS`) is a stratified Horvitz-Thompson design (Ruling
R67). The certainty stratum is the plan's `census_head` — the source's
and the synthetic side's top-254 values — included with probability 1
(weight 1), so no heavy hitter is left to the hash. The tail is
Poisson-sampled by the value hash: a value enters iff `code mod M < K`,
a Bernoulli(rate) draw per VALUE independent of its counts, side and
R/H membership (weight w = 1 / rate). Every retained value's counts are
exact. Estimators (w_v = 1 in the head, 1 / rate in the tail):

    distinct counts     Σ_sampled w_v                           unbiased
    Σ_v f(counts_v)     Σ_sampled w_v f — TVD, JSD, w², the     unbiased
      (totals exact)    tvd_null floor, entropy's Σ c ln c,     (Horvitz &
                        rarefaction, baselines                  Thompson)
    shares (copy rate,  Σ w_v y_v / Σ w_v x_v, the combined      ratio,
      adherence,        ratio of two Horvitz-Thompson totals    unbiased to
      coverage, novelty)                                        first order
    lifts               values in the hash range only (head or not): a
                        uniform draw, R, H, E, H_E thinned alike, so the
                        rates' ratio is unchanged

The copy rate (and category adherence) on a value-sampled column carries
a cluster-robust interval with the values as the sampling units
(`noise.stratified_ratio_interval`, R70): the head is counted exactly,
so only the tail's ratio q̂ is uncertain; its tail row total is exact too
(the dense non-null count for adherence; for the copy rate the census
counts substantive synthetic rows over every present value, before the
value sample), so R̂ = (Y_head + X_tail q̂) / (X_head + X_tail). q̂ gets a
Korn & Graubard (1998) Clopper-Pearson interval on its effective sample
size — linearised variance with the (1 - rate) factor, capped at the
tail's effective cluster count (Σx)² / Σx², with K&G's t degrees-of-
freedom factor — mapped through that function with the head as a known
constant, so a sample without a copy still bounds the rate. Novelty is
1 - adherence there (one estimator). The Horvitz-Thompson view is
validated before use — Σ c ln c within [0, n ln n] on each side, shares
and TVD/JSD at most 1, a positive source entropy — and a metric whose
view fails is `not_evaluated` with the reason, never a crash. Chao-Shen
(detail only) is not estimated on a value-sampled column, and
`column.distinct_ceiling_hit` is `not_evaluated` there (the exact K_syn
is not measured); its top-k profile is exact on the head and carries
`value_sample_rate`.

Rare values and lifts. A value is rare when 0 < c_src < 10 in the census
(the full source read; the repo's k-anonymity floor). With V_S the rare,
substantive values held by panel set S and not by its exchangeable twin
(D3), `field.value_memorization_lift` compares m_R / |V_R| with
m_H / |V_H|, m_S = the values of V_S the synthetic side reproduces at
least once (distinct values: one value copied many times is one
event, which keeps the counts close to Poisson), via the conditional
rate-ratio test with a Clopper-Pearson interval at alpha / m — Bonferroni
over the m columns of the table whose lift has exposure on both sides
(`detail.bonferroni_family`); status gates on ci_low (R1, R12, R38).
`detail.exposure` repeats it for E vs H_E (not gated).
`field.pool_memorization_lift` counts m_S = |P ∩ V_S| over the free-text
pool P of the run's (reference digest, model) — a side input the CLI
fills from `freetext_pools_table` (`read_pools`); absent, it is
`not_evaluated` with the reason; each pooled column is its own test at
an uncorrected alpha. An unverified reference, or an empty synthetic
side, makes both lifts `not_evaluated` (Review Focus 5); fidelity is
still computed.

Shapes follow ADR 0026 as `stats.shapes` implements it, over EVERY
present value — the mask pass is never value-sampled (R67), so
`column.shape_head_tv` and `field.shape_adherence` are exact. Masks are
keyed by their hash and pre-aggregated like values. A mask is a head
mask when it holds at least 2 % of the source's non-empty values (a
per-mask decision from its own count and the dense total, so no global
head set has to be broadcast); every other mask pools into the tail.
Masks longer than 256 characters pool into one `<long>` bucket at
count time, which is never a head and never counts toward adherence.

Literals (D6, R56, R64): a top-k label is the value itself only when the
column is `literal_ok`, `hash64(name, v)` is in its (source-built)
`detection_dictionary` and the census counts it at least 10 times in the
source; everything else — every synthetic-only value — is
`canonical.hashed_label(code, key=label_key)`, keyed BLAKE2b, so a label
cannot be reversed by enumerating a small domain. A shape mask is shown
when it holds at least 10 source values and contains a class
placeholder (9, A, a, ␣); a mask that is only literal characters is the
value itself, so it is labelled.

`field.substantive_copy_rate` is gated only on `text` columns: `scoring`
reports it as INFO on every other kind, from `column_kind` (numeric and
temporal values collide by domain size; reusing a rare real category or
identifier is not memorisation — Ruling R66). `detail.day_granularity`
still records a temporal column's granularity.

Sampled mode (Ruling R72, as in `beam.membership`): a side whose plan
rate is below 1 was read as a row sample (`CensusSpec.rate_source` /
`rate_synthetic`). A metric defined by the value SET of a side — or by
an exact count of it — is `not_evaluated` there with "sampled mode
cannot measure …; run exact mode", what the sample did see in `detail`
(named `*_lower_bound` where it bounds the full count) and
`detail.sample_rates`:

                                                  sampled looks unseen
    column.coverage_mass          the synthetic   a source value whose
                                                  synthetic rows were not

                                                  measured

Every other row that reads a sampled side is an estimate over the rows
read: `method` = sample, `sample_rate` = the lowest rate among the
sampled sides it reads, `detail.sample_rates` naming each (a
value-sampled column's own rate moves to `detail.value_sample_rate`).
Its totals are the dense pass's counts of the rows READ, so every
interval and noise floor is the sample's. The lifts stay evaluated: R
and H are thinned alike by a sample drawn on row content, so the ratio
keeps its null; "rare" is then judged on the sample's counts. A profile
of a sampled side carries `sample_rate` in its payload.
