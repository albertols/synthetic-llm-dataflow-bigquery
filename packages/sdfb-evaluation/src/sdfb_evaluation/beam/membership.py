Hashes (`beam.encode`): `nonkey_hash` is the salted linear hash of the
non-key cells (no PK, identity or FK column), so a record copied under a
fresh key still matches; `row_hash` covers every column. A table's
RECORD hash is its non-key hash — or, for an all-key table (every column
a key, no content), its row hash: the key tuple is then the record, so
its copies are still flagged, though the content metrics are not
evaluated. A row whose record cells are all NULL has one constant record
hash: it carries no content and is NEVER a match, near match or internal
duplicate (Ruling R60).

Exact sets and the lifts (D3). With U_S the distinct record hashes of
panel set S, the exclusive sets are R \\ H and H \\ R — a record both
halves hold is common, and hitting it is chance — and, for the exposure
lift, E \\ H against H_E \\ R; (R \\ H) \\ E against (H \\ R) \\ H_E (the
exclusive records outside the exposed prefixes) give `detail.unexposed`,
or a reason when either is empty (a steep-tailed source can hold every
exclusive R record inside E). R and H are exchangeable halves of one
ranking, so under the null a synthetic generator hits either exclusive
set alike. The EVENT is a distinct exclusive record the synthetic side
reproduces at least once, never a synthetic row: a record hit by many
synthetic rows is one event, which keeps the counts close to Poisson.
Counting rows instead would weight every chance hit by the synthetic
rows its pattern draws, which on a skewed table puts the whole R/H
selection noise into a narrow Poisson interval (a simulation at
n_syn ≫ n missed 1 in 39-81 % of null runs, against 0-1 % for distinct
records). The row counts are in `detail` (`rows_r`/`rows_h`); a record
copied many times still shows in `row.exact_match_rate_nonkey` and in
the flags. The lift is the conditional rate-ratio test of the event
counts over the exclusive set sizes, with a Clopper-Pearson interval
(Przyborowski & Wilenski, 1940; Clopper & Pearson, 1934); status reads
ci_low (Rulings R1, R12, R38: no event on either side leaves the value
NULL with ci_low 0).

Near matches (leave one out, Ruling R2). Row x's key at non-key column j
is `canonical.loo_hashes`: its non-key hash without column j's term, so
two rows equal in every non-key column but j share it. A synthetic row
near-matches set S when, at some j, its key equals the key of an S row at
the same j AND every other non-key cell code equals that row's
(`hash64` per cell, compared exactly: a linear-hash collision is
rejected). A row that matches an R or an H record exactly is never a
near match of either set (exact matches are counted as exact). The
dropped column's all-NULL remainder is never a key (R60).
`row.near_match_rate` is the share of synthetic rows near-matching R
(Wilson, 1927); the near lift counts distinct exclusive keys (a key of R
not held by H at the same column, and vice versa), as the exact lift
does. Fewer than two non-key columns leave nothing to compare once one
is dropped.

The full source. `row.exact_match_rate` (every column) and
`row.exact_match_rate_nonkey` compare the synthetic side with every
source row read:

    source side input fits SOURCE_SET_MAX_BYTES  sorted distinct source
      (`context.budget.source_sets_fit`: 8 B a   hashes, one CombineGlobally
      source row and array; the record hashes,   per table, read with

      has content: 20M rows key-less or          map-side, so full-source
      all-key, 10M keyed, at 160 MB)             exact copies are flagged
    above it, or the source count unknown        the keyed count below IS the
                                                  co-grouping: Σ c_syn over
                                                  the hashes with c_src ≥ 1;
                                                  no full-source flag (panel
                                                  flags remain)

Task 26 sizes `max_cache_memory_usage_mb` (Beam 2.74 defaults to 0, no
side-input cache) to the SUM of the side inputs a worker holds at once,
so each is materialised once; the derived panel index is built once per
worker behind `apache_beam.utils.shared.Shared`, tagged by the panel's
content token.

Keyed counts (all tables, one pass). Every hash is counted exactly per
side, in `(table, kind, bucket)` keys — the hash space split by its top
bits into up to 2^MAX_BUCKET_BITS buckets of about KEY_BUCKET_CODES codes
each:

    nk     non-key hash, both sides   internal duplicates (the frequency
                                      of frequencies of each side); the
                                      keyed full-source non-key matches
    pk     PK hash, synthetic         table.pk_duplicate_rate (a NULL part is
    id     identity hash, synthetic   no key: counted as `null_key_rows`,
                                      never a duplicate)
    row    row hash, both sides       keyed mode only, keyed tables only

A value is SPARSE and packed: one side's sorted codes as little-endian
uint64 bytes and their counts at the smallest unsigned width that holds
them — primitives FastPrimitivesCoder writes without pickling. `RowKeysFn`
merges the batches of a bundle per key before it emits (flushing when it
holds FLUSH_CODES codes), and `KeyCountsCombineFn.compact` merges a
lifted accumulator to one part per side before it crosses the shuffle, so
a code costs about 9 B (budgeted as `context.budget.MEMBERSHIP_CODE_BYTES`).

Internal duplicates at matched n (Ruling R73, amending R59). The share of
rows whose content is held twice or more grows with n, so both sides are
compared at m = min(n_src, n_syn) content rows by exact rarefaction from
each side's frequency of frequencies (Hurlbert, 1971; Heck, van Belle &
Simberloff, 1975): a record held c times among N rows keeps X ~
Hypergeometric(N, c, m) of them in a subsample of m, so

    E[D_m] = Σ_c f_c · (c·m/N - P(X = 1))    rows in duplicate groups

and `row.internal_duplicate_excess` = (E[D_m]_syn - E[D_m]_src) / m (the
smaller side is not subsampled: its value is its observed share). Noise:
under the null the two sides are exchangeable, each a random m-subset of
their pooled rows, and D_m = m - F1 (the rows of records held once), so
the null variance is Var(F1) of an m-subset of the pool — exact from the
pooled frequency of frequencies with the multivariate hypergeometric
(`duplicate_null_variance`), divided by the finite-population factor
1 - m / (n_src + n_syn) so it is the variance of an m-row sample of the
population rather than of the pool (Cochran, 1977; two sides of equal
size are complementary halves of the pool, whose difference varies twice
as much as a half does alone). Rows of one duplicate group are not
independent draws and a heavy record adds no variance at all, so each
side's count enters Newcombe's (1998) interval through Korn & Graubard's
(1998) effective sample size n* = d (1 - d) / Var(d), capped at m — the
catalogue's `newcombe` noise method then reads a faithful generator's
difference as noise. `baseline_value` = the same at min(|R|, n_src) for
R against the source (D4).

Sampled mode (Ruling R72). A side read as a row sample (`--mode
sampled`, rate < 1: a salted content-hash sample that keeps identical
rows together) cannot support a verdict that needs every row of a side:
the full-source match rates (the source side), the PK/identity duplicate
rates (the synthetic side) and internal duplicates (both) are
`not_evaluated` with "sampled mode cannot measure …; run exact mode" and
the observed lower-bound count in `detail`. The panel-based rates and
lifts compare R/H/E, read in full, with the synthetic rows read, so they
stay evaluated with `method` = sample and the synthetic `sample_rate`
(also in `detail`).

Flags. A top-k of DISTINCT candidates per (table, check) for
`exact_copy` and `near_copy` (distinct by the synthetic row hash and the
source record's code, so a record copied 200 times into a key-less table
takes one slot), ranked by the set a row copies (E — an exclusive E
record — then R, H, the full source), then a salted SplitMix64 spread of
its row hash (Steele, Lea & Flood, 2014), then its synthetic handle:
deterministic for an evaluation, and a sample, not the first rows read.
A flag carries:

    synthetic_key     the synthetic row's handle: its PK tuple, else its
                      identity tuple, as JSON (NULL for a table with
                      neither). It is the synthetic table's own key, not
                      covered by D6 hashing — so for a full-row copy
                      (keys included) it IS the copied source row's key
    source_key_hash   `canonical.hashed_label` of the matched source
                      record's code with the worker-side label key
                      (Rulings R64, R68): its PK hash; else its identity
                      hash; else (no PK, no identity) its record hash —
                      the row hash itself when the table has no key
                      column. A full-source copy is labelled only in the
                      last case (map-side the source record's key is
                      unknown), NULL otherwise
    source_key        always NULL (`row_flags_source_keys=raw` is refused)

No attribute value is ever written. With an unverified reference only
full-source flags are written: the panel sets are not known to be the
generator's.

An unverified reference (`Panel.verified` False) makes every R/H/E-based
metric `not_evaluated` with `UNVERIFIED_REASON` and the panel's own
reason; the full-source metrics are still computed.

Failures stay per table. A table whose spec or panel cannot be built on
the driver, or whose batches raise a data error on a worker
(`TABLE_ERRORS`), writes `not_evaluated` rows with the reason for every
owned id and no flags; the other tables and the pipeline carry on.
