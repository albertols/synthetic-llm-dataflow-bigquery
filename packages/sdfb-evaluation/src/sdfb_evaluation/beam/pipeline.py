    FINAL registry row ◄── AsIter(every signal) ────────────────┘
      └─► sinks: evaluation_data_history

The label key is made ONCE on a worker (`LabelKey`, R64/R68) and the
same one-element PCollection feeds Dense, Census, Membership and
Privacy (their flags and labels) as `AsSingleton`; only its URI enters
the graph, and `--experiments=enable_data_sampling` is never set (it
would sample the key into the monitoring UI).

The FINAL row waits for every write to commit (D7). `BigQuerySinks`
returns `WriteToBigQuery`'s `destination_load_jobid_pairs` and
`destination_copy_jobid_pairs`, `LocalJsonSinks` its finalised files,
and the FINAL step reads every one of them as an `AsIter` side input.
What the two job-id PCollections are in Beam 2.74 (read in the installed
`apache_beam/io/gcp/bigquery_file_loads.py`):

    PCollection   produced by                       relative to the wait
    ────────────  ────────────────────────────────  ────────────────────
    load pairs    `TriggerLoadJobs.process()`, its  yielded when the job
                  ONGOING_JOBS tagged output        is SUBMITTED; the
                                                    wait on it comes
                                                    later, in
                                                    `finish_bundle`
    copy pairs    `TriggerCopyJobs.finish_bundle`,  yielded after the
                  its main output (temp-table       wait on each job
                  loads only: empty when a table
                  loads in one partition)

So a load pair is not, by itself, a finished load job. The ordering
rests on two runner guarantees instead: a bundle's outputs are committed
only when the bundle completes, `finish_bundle` included — the wait
belongs to the bundle that yielded the pair, and a failed job raises
there and fails that bundle — and a batch side input can be read only
once its whole PCollection is computed (the side-input barrier). The
FINAL step therefore cannot start before the bundles that submitted AND
awaited every load and copy job are done.

Failures stay per table (the run continues, nothing is dropped):

    where                             the table's rows
    ────────────────────────────────  ─────────────────────────────────────
    driver: a side cannot be read,    every owned metric not_evaluated
      the layout/spec/panel refs      with the reason (`failed_table_
      raise                           metrics`); no transform sees it
    worker: a batch fails to encode   every metric row it produced
                                      rewritten not_evaluated (Guard); its
                                      profiles and flags dropped
    inside a transform                the transform's own per-table
                                      handling (membership, privacy,
                                      relational)

The first two make the run PARTIAL with the reason — FAILED when they
leave no launch table evaluated (`assemble`'s status table); a
transform's own not_evaluated rows only count. A worker's `MemoryError`
is not a data error: it fails the bundle, which the runner retries.

What the driver saw fail is a CONSTANT of the graph: the Guard and the
FINAL step receive it as a plain argument, so no graded row of such a
table can exist whatever a runner does with a side input. Only a
worker's failure, unknown until the job runs, travels in the `failures`
side input.

Runners. That side input, the profile and flag filters, the FINAL row
written after every sink signal and every side input inside the
transforms (the label key, the panel sets, the parent key sets) rest on
one contract of batch execution: a side input is COMPLETE before the
step that reads it runs.

    runner                              the contract
    ──────────────────────────────────  ─────────────────────────────────
    Dataflow (batch)                    holds
    FnApiRunner (Beam's in-process      holds: a stage runs to completion
      Python runner)                    before the stages reading it
    Prism — what Beam's `DirectRunner`  does NOT hold (2.74, unchanged in
      hands a batch pipeline to         2.76): a step is "ready" once its
                                        side input's watermark has caught
                                        up with its main input's
                                        (`engine/elementmanager.go`,
                                        `stageState.bundleReady`), and
                                        both sit at the end-of-global-
                                        window timestamp while a
                                        GroupByKey's output is in flight
                                        on each branch — the step then
                                        runs with the side input as far as
                                        it has got, possibly empty

On Prism a failed table's `table.row_count_ratio` was published PASS
and its roll-ups scored, in the runs where the failure map was still in
its `CombinePerKey` while the relational rows left their `GroupByKey`.
So a local run is in process: `pipeline_options_defaults` turns
`DirectRunner` into `FnApiRunner`, and `build_evaluation_pipeline`
refuses a pipeline whose runner is Beam's switching `DirectRunner` or
`PrismRunner` rather than run with rows that may be wrong.

Runner defaults (`pipeline_options_defaults`): the runner as above;
`save_main_session` False (every DoFn is importable);
`max_cache_memory_usage_mb` sized to the side inputs a worker holds at
once (Beam 2.74's default is 0: no side-input cache, so every bundle
would re-read them) and at least 512; on Dataflow
`--experiments=upload_graph` (a graph this wide exceeds the job-creation
request limit).

`prepare_evaluation` runs the plan's DDL before the pipeline, with two
degradations instead of a failed job: a source pin (snapshot clone)
BigQuery refuses — a source in another organisation or region — reads
the source unpinned with a warning; and a read-only parent whose table
cannot be read (a `LIMIT 0` dry run: `tables.get` succeeding does not
mean `tables.getData` does) loses that side, so its edges say why
instead of failing at DIRECT_READ. Both degrade only on a REFUSAL — an
HTTP 400, 403 or 404, which `context.bq` raises as `BqApiError(status=
400)`, `PermissionError` and `LookupError`. Anything else (a 5xx, a 429,
a conflict, an error with no status) may succeed on a retry, so it
raises and the driver writes the FAILED row: a transient error never
silently changes what the evaluation reads.
