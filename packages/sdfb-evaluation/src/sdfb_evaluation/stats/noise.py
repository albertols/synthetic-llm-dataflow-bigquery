"""Sampling-noise floors, proportion/difference intervals, and the
conditional rate-ratio test that Task 14's scorer gates a metric's `value`
against before calling a threshold crossing a real regression: "a metric
fails only if `value` crosses the fail threshold *and* exceeds its noise
floor" (D5).

Each function is one estimator of how much wobble chance alone puts on a
statistic at a given sample size, named for the catalogue's `noise_floor`
vocabulary (`src/sdfb_evaluation/catalogue/metrics.yaml`, `noise_floor:`
column). `noise_floor` is the dispatcher Task 14 calls with that vocabulary
directly. Three of its methods return an interval (`ci_low`/`ci_high`), not
a scalar floor — `wilson`, `newcombe` and `rate_ratio` — so their own metric
producers call `wilson_interval`/`newcombe_diff_interval`/`rate_ratio`
directly and the dispatcher returns `None` for them; `delong` (the AUC
noise floor) is implemented in `stats/detection.py` (a later task), and the
dispatcher returns `None` for it here too, pending that.
`folded_abs_interval` turns a signed difference interval into one for the
catalogue's unsigned deltas.

  Design: the VALUES are the sampling units (every row of a value moves
  with it, so rows are clustered). The head is a certainty stratum —
  known exactly, no sampling variance; the tail is Poisson-sampled, each
  value independently with probability `rate`. With X_t the tail's x
  total — `tail_total` when the caller counted it exactly (the census
  does: every row passes through it before the value sample), else its
  Horvitz-Thompson estimate x_t / rate (Horvitz & Thompson, 1952) — and
  q̂ = y_t / x_t the tail's sample ratio, the estimate is

      R̂ = (Y_head + X_t q̂) / (X_head + X_t).

  With an exact X_t only q̂ carries sampling noise, so the interval is
  built for q̂ alone and mapped through that monotone function, the head
  added back as a known constant (an HT X_t is treated as known too,
  which undercovers when the head holds most of Y). For q̂: the
  linearised variance of a ratio of sample sums under Poisson sampling
  (Woodruff, 1971; Särndal, Swensson & Wretman, 1992),

      V̂(q̂) = (1 - rate) · Σ_tail e² / x_t² · s / (s - 1),

  and Korn & Graubard's (1998) Clopper-Pearson interval on the effective
  sample size n* = q̂ (1 - q̂) / V̂, with R̂ n* events. n* is capped at the
  tail's effective cluster count (Σx)² / Σx² (Kish), which is also n*
  when q̂ is 0 or 1 or V̂ is 0 — so a sample without a copy still bounds
  the rate by how many clusters it saw — and is scaled by K&G's degrees-
  of-freedom factor [t_{n-1} / t_{s-1}]² (n = the tail's rows), which
  widens the interval when few clusters were sampled. With no sampled
  tail value q is unknown: the point takes the head's ratio and the

  empty).
