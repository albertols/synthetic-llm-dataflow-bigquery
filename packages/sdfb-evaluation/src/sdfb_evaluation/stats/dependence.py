"""Dependence from dense accumulators: one mergeable `BivariateAccumulator`
per (table, side) over a plan-fixed list of column pairs, feeding
`pair.pearson_delta`, `pair.spearman_delta`, `pair.cramers_v_delta`,
`pair.nmi_delta`, `pair.contingency_tvd`, `table.corr_rms_delta` and
`table.corr_max_delta` (`src/sdfb_evaluation/catalogue/metrics.yaml`).

The Beam accumulator (a later task) feeds `BivariateAccumulator.add_batch`
one `(b, d)` numpy batch per bundle — `d` is the accumulator's own column
list (the union of columns its `pairs` index into, not the whole table) —
then merges accumulators pairwise across bundles/workers via `merge`. Two
parallel co-moment tables are kept per pair: `com_std` over values
standardized by the PLAN's mean/std (feeds `pair.pearson_delta`), and
`com_pit` over each side's own MID-CDF probability-integral transform
(feeds `pair.spearman_delta`) — `F_bar(x) = F(x) - p(x) / 2`, i.e. `(mid
rank - 0.5) / n` with ties given their AVERAGE rank (`scipy.stats.rankdata
(..., method="average")`), never a plain `rank / n`: the mid-CDF is what
keeps a tied column's PIT unbiased, and it is what makes
`pearson_from_comoments(com_pit)` agree with `scipy.stats.spearmanr` to
near machine precision even under heavy ties (Ruling R24; see
`test_pit_spearman_with_ties_matches_scipy_tightly`).

`com_std`/`com_pit` hold CENTERED co-moments per pair, `(n, mean_x, mean_y,
M2_x, M2_y, C_xy)` — `M2 = sum((x - mean_x) ** 2)`, `C_xy = sum((x -
mean_x) * (y - mean_y))`, both over the pair's PAIRWISE-COMPLETE rows (a
row missing either side, `NaN` in `z_std`/`z_pit`, contributes to neither).
This is `stats.moments.Moments`' representation generalized to two
variables (Ruling R23), not the sum-form `(n, Sx, Sy, Sxx, Syy, Sxy)` a
naive implementation might reach for: `add_batch` computes ONE batch's
co-moments via the "shifted data" trick — every column is first shifted by
its own batch mean before any product is summed, so the products stay near
the data's own scale regardless of how large or badly-centered the
caller's `z_std`/`z_pit` values are — and then folds that batch into the
running total with the Chan, Golub & LeVeque (1983) / Pébay (2008) pairwise
merge, the same delta-based update `stats.moments.Moments.merge` uses for
a single variable, generalized to a mean pair and a covariance term. The
result is accurate even for a value shifted far from zero with a tiny
spread relative to that shift (the same pathology raw epoch-microsecond
timestamps show — see `test_offset_plan_z_is_stable_across_many_batches`),
because nothing here ever sums a large raw value directly; only the
per-batch shift needs to be reasonably close to that batch's own mean, and
using the batch's own mean makes it exact by construction.

`counts2d` is the joint bin/dictionary table each pair needs for
`pair.cramers_v_delta`, `pair.nmi_delta` and `pair.contingency_tvd`: `codes`
carries one integer slot per column per row, `0..bins-1` for a bin or
dictionary entry and `bins` itself for a null — so every row lands somewhere
in the `(bins + 1, bins + 1)` table, the null bin included on both axes.
Every row contributes regardless of nulls (unlike the co-moments), and the
whole batch is folded in through a one-hot Gram matrix over all `d`
columns at once, not a per-pair gather.

  two columns of `z` — the "shifted data" algorithm (Chan, Golub & LeVeque,
  1983) computed over dense `(d, d)` matrix products (BLAS), not a
  per-pair loop.

  Every column is first shifted by its OWN mean over its own non-null rows
  (`shift`, `(d,)`) — a per-column, whole-batch mean, not restricted to any
  one pair's pairwise-complete subset — so the products summed below stay
  near the data's own scale regardless of `z`'s raw magnitude or offset.
  `mask` (`M` in the module docstring) is `~isnan(z)`; `z0` is the shifted
  `z` with nulls zeroed. Four `(d, d)` Gram matrices then give every
  column-PAIR's pairwise-complete count and shifted sums in one product
  each: `n_dd = M^T M`, `sx_dd = z0^T M` (pair `(c1, c2)`'s sum of
  shifted `c1`, restricted to rows where `c1` AND `c2` are both present —
  `M`'s second factor supplies that restriction), `sxx_dd = (z0^2)^T M`,
  `sxy_dd = z0^T z0` (symmetric; nulls already zeroed on both sides, so no
  extra masking is needed). Only the `P` pairs this accumulator tracks are
  then read off by `i_idx`/`j_idx` — `sx_dd`/`sxx_dd` are NOT symmetric
  (`sx_dd[c1, c2]` sums `c1`'s shifted values, `sx_dd[c2, c1]` sums `c2`'s,
  over the SAME row subset), so a pair's `y`-side sum reads the transpose:
  `sy = sx_dd[j_idx, i_idx]`, `syy = sxx_dd[j_idx, i_idx]`.

  The centered co-moments themselves recover exactly from these shifted
  sums: `mean = shift + S / n`, `M2 = Sxx - Sx**2 / n`, `C = Sxy - Sx*Sy /
  n` — exact regardless of how close `shift` is to the TRUE pairwise mean,
  since `shift` only needs to keep the summed products near-zero-scaled for
  numerical stability, not to equal any particular mean.

  A pair with zero pairwise-complete rows in this batch (`n == 0`) gets
  `mean = M2 = C = 0` exactly (not `shift + 0/0`): `_merge_bivariate_
  comoments`'s `n_b == 0` branch never reads those values when folding this
  batch in, but zeroing them keeps this function's own output well-defined
