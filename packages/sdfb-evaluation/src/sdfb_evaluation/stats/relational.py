"""Parent/child relational maths: the pure functions behind every
`relationship.*` entry in `catalogue/metrics.yaml` — fan-out shape (TVD,
W1, mean ratio), childless-parent share, cardinality adherence, parent
coverage, and the foreign-key orphan rate.

A parent-driven launch generates every child from its parent's landed keys
(ADR 0036/0037), so these metrics compare the resulting children-per-parent
distribution against the source's, not individual rows. `fanout_histogram`
turns one count per parent into a fixed-width histogram; `fanout_metrics`
turns a pair of those (plus the exact means/extremes a capped histogram
alone cannot recover) into every `relationship.fanout_*`/
`relationship.parent_coverage` value. `orphan_summary` is the SQL MATCH
SIMPLE-aware rate/denominator shared by `relationship.orphan_rate` (on the
synthetic table) and `relationship.orphan_rate_source` (the baseline).

      (`wilson_interval(count, n_syn)` — the catalogue declares
      `noise_floor: wilson` for this metric). Exact when `max_src < cap`
      (every count that matters is an exact histogram bin). When
      `max_src >= cap`, the whole `>= cap` bin is approximated as inside
      the range — `cardinality_adherence_exact` records which case
      applied. That approximation can be wrong in EITHER direction once
      `max_src >= cap`: a synthetic parent counted there could in truth
      exceed `max_src` (over-counted), and if `min_src > cap` too, an
      overflow parent could equally be genuinely below `min_src`
      (under-counted) — the histogram alone cannot distinguish any of
