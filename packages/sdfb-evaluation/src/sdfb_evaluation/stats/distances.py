"""Distances on count vectors: the pure maths behind `column.tvd`,
`column.jsd`, `column.psi` and `column.cohens_w`.

Every function here takes either raw counts or already-normalized
probabilities over the same fixed category/bin ordering — `normalize`
handles the conversion internally, so a caller never has to pre-divide by a
total — except `psi`, whose credit-risk pseudo-count smoothing is defined
directly on counts and would be meaningless applied twice. `align` builds
that shared ordering from two `Mapping[category, count]` sources over the
union of their keys, for callers (`packages/sdfb_evaluation/catalogue`'s
`column.tvd`/`column.jsd`/`column.cohens_w`) that start from two dicts
rather than two same-length arrays.
