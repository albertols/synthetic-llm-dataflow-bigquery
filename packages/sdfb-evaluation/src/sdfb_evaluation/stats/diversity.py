"""Diversity census at matched n: one mergeable accumulator per column that
feeds `column.entropy_ratio`, `column.distinct_ratio`, `column.coverage_mass`,
`column.novelty_mass`, `column.top1_share_delta`, `field.category_adherence`
and `field.substantive_copy_rate` (`src/sdfb_evaluation/catalogue/metrics.yaml`).

The Beam census (a later task) streams one `(value_hash, c_src, c_syn,
c_src_m, c_syn_m)` row per DISTINCT value of a column into `CensusAccumulator
.add`, then merges accumulators pairwise across bundles/workers via `merge`,
and finally calls `summarize`. `c_src`/`c_syn` are counts over ALL rows;
`c_src_m`/`c_syn_m` restrict to rows a row-hash Bernoulli flag selected for
the matched-n subsample, `m = min(n_src, n_syn)` — entropy and distinct
counts are n-dependent (a plug-in estimate on more rows looks more diverse
for no real reason), so both sides are compared at the same `m`, while
coverage/novelty/top1 are not (their catalogue entries are `n_dependent:
false`) and are computed on the full counts instead.

PRECONDITION: every value key is added via `add` exactly once, after the
upstream `CombinePerKey` has already grouped rows by (column, value) — two
accumulators being `merge`d must never have both seen the same value key.
`k_src`/`k_syn`/`f1_src`/etc. and the pairwise-summed `merge` below are only
exact under that precondition; nothing here can detect a violation of it.

Chao & Shen (2003) entropy needs the GLOBAL sample-coverage estimate before
any per-value term can be computed, so `summarize` does not attempt it from
the accumulator alone (Ruling R3): it reports the coverage estimate only
(`chao_shen_coverage_src_m`/`_syn_m`, from `f1_src_m`/`f1_syn_m`), and the
Beam census (Task 22) sums `chao_shen_term` itself in a second pass, once it
also has every value's raw count in hand. `chao_shen_bits` is the same maths
in one pass, for a caller that already has the whole count vector (detail
reporting, tests).
