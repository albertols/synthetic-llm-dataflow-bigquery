"""Exact binned-CDF maths: edge construction, bin counting, and the
distance metrics `column.ks`, `column.pit_w1` and `column.wasserstein` build
on.

Every metric here is computed from bin COUNTS on a fixed set of edges, never
from the raw rows: the planning query's `APPROX_QUANTILES(x, 1000)` gives a
1,001-point grid per side, and Task 21's Beam accumulator turns every row
into an exact count against that fixed grid (`bin_counts`). Nothing here
re-reads a raw value, which is what lets a table-sized column be measured
with two passes (plan, then count) instead of a sort.

CDFs are evaluated at the edges themselves, right-continuous: bin `i` is
`(e[i-1], e[i]]` (`e[-1] = -inf`), so `F(e[i])` is exact — it is exactly
`cumsum(counts)[i] / total`, not an interpolation. That convention is what
makes `w1_from_bins`'s integral exact for a step CDF rather than merely a
trapezoidal approximation of one (see its docstring).
