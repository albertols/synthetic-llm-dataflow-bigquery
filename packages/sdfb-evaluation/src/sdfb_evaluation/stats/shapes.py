"""Shape masks and character-class profiles: the pure maths behind
`column.shape_head_tv` and `column.char_class_l1`.

`shape_of`, `collapse` and `char_class_presence` (originally `_charclasses`)
are VERBATIM ports of `scripts/e2e/freetext_crosscheck.py` — copied, never
imported, because this package stays independent of everything outside it
(`test_independence.py`, ADR 0041). `shape_head_tv` is likewise a verbatim
port of that script's `_shape_tv`, with its module-level `_SHAPE_MASS_MIN`
constant turned into an explicit `floor` parameter (default 0.02, the same
value) so a caller here does not need a second constant to stay in sync
with the script's.

`char_class_fractions` and `char_class_l1` are new: the first turns a batch
of raw values into the same `{class: fraction of non-empty values
containing it}` profile `freetext_crosscheck.py`'s `_profile_sample` builds
inline (for the Beam census pass, which needs it as a standalone,
mergeable-friendly step); the second is the L1 distance between two such
profiles.
