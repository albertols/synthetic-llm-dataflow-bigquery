"""Standalone statistical evaluation of synthetic BigQuery tables.

Measures fidelity, privacy, and utility of a landed synthetic table against
its live source — a post-write sibling to the generation pipeline, never a
dependency of it (ADR 0041). This package imports none of `sdfb_core`,
`sdfb_beam`, or `sdfb_tests`; it has its own `pyproject.toml`, `uv.lock`, and
Python pin, and installs and runs with only the generator packages absent.

Design: docs/designs/2026-07-07-evaluation-framework-design.md
