"""The image's one Flex Template entry (`FLEX_TEMPLATE_PYTHON_PY_FILE`).

One image and one template serve two jobs (ADR 0009; ADR 0041, amendment
of 2026-10-06). The template launcher runs this file with the launch's
parameters as `--name=value` flags; one of them, `--sdfb_job`, says which
job the launch is:

    --sdfb_job            entry called
    ────────────────────  ──────────────────────────────────────────
    absent, empty,        sdfb_beam.cli.run_pipeline.main
    generation              (the generator: synthetic rows on GPU workers)
    evaluation            sdfb_evaluation.cli.run_evaluation.main
                            (the evaluator: scores a landed run, CPU workers)

The selector is removed and every other argument reaches the entry
unchanged and in order, so a launch without the selector behaves as it did
when `run_pipeline.py` was the entry itself. Both spellings are read:
`--sdfb_job=evaluation` and `--sdfb_job evaluation`.

    exit code   meaning
    ─────────   ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    (entry's)   whatever the chosen entry returned
    2           the selector names neither job, or has no value; or
                `evaluation` was asked of an image built from a tree
                without `packages/sdfb-evaluation`. Nothing was started.

The chosen entry is imported after the selector is read, and only that one:
a generation launch never imports the evaluator, an evaluation launch never
imports the generator. Neither package knows the other; this file is the
only place that names both.

Design: docs/DESIGN.md §1 Architecture; §11 Evaluation (sdfb-evaluation)
(ADR 0009, 0041).
